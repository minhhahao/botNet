I don't know about the other guy, but semantic whitespace is one of the worst ideas ever. It was a mistake in Make back in 1977, and the idea that someone would design a new language with the same bad idea 15 years later is maddening.

Yeah, but bikers aren't going as fast and can stop faster than cars; are smaller than cars and will not do much damage if *they* hit a car or person (which is unlikely), and can maneuver much better than a car.

God actually made evolution so he could test our faith, he didn't just put evidence of it.
This is great. There are several evangelical religions that are capable of mobilizing lots of people. We would have a space race like never before.  As an added bonus, building the technical capabilities and going out to space might knock some sense to their collective asses!

Seriously. I fast forwarded like 2 minutes when it was kind of slow and almost the entire minimap was purple. Lots of queens early on really helps.
I was talking about downloading the nice big videos so that you can watch it full-screen in gloriously high resolution and admire all of the animation and art in high resolution with no artefacts. If you want to skimp on the experience and watch it on YouTube, suit yourself.

Sorry man. Glad to see things worked out for you though! :)
True.  I've just never really thought of myself as 'pretty'.  In my mind, pretty seems like a feminine adjective.  And I think I'm rather masculine in my appearance--broad forehead, beard, body hair, the usual muscles male runners and cyclists get--that sort of thing.
'-yo' is a polite suffix for ending sentences when speaking in korean.

Hey rooly, the first video is intended as an intro... it gets more complex in the other ones... but the first video is intended to be very easy to understand... Your firin' lazah comment was the best...

I wouldn't call it a *good* book, but yeah, those that equate Satanism with Christian mythology would do well to read it.
A surprising number of people are friends with people they don't know and never met.  I totally don't understand that.

'anti-humor guy...' [Norm MacDonald](http://videogum.com/15201/norm_macdonalds_genius_roast_of_bob_saget/stand-up-comedy/)?  If so, I agree.  That was genius.
I suppose so, which means his second idea would really be the more viable one.  Or perhaps I am completely misinterpreting what he is saying.
how much does it cost?
Absolutely, not to get overly PC, but the 1 primary/multiple secondaries is not an uncommon model and there's no reason for it to be mean.

I don't think judges can order someone to 'shut up'. I feel that implies all sorts of bias and could get a case thrown out.
You have to understand his position, which is to make capitalism sound awful, you cannot expect him to actually defend it. 
Money is pretty much as abstract as nearly any reward system that has ever been successfully implemented.

I don't really have much of a problem with that. I accept science I don't understand to be true all the time. It's much more problematic when people start actively disbelieving hard science for no logical reason.

Why should I move just because someone is using force to remove my rightful possessions, though?  Then it's still coercion via the use of force.

In fairness, at least this guy admitted he just looked it up on Wikipedia, unlike most people who just do it and act authoritative.  Even worse, though, is the vast majority who know nothing about the issues or people at hand but are quick to barf up worthless advice.

This. Is. Such. A. Good. Idea. I will let you know as soon as I acquire the funds to purchase minecraft. I've had my eye on it for a while.   Yes I know it's ten dollars.
You do, assuming your store still has the cards. I've got one of them sitting in my binder right now.
Peeing is somewhat less convenient in yours. Or at least I hope so.

The ones using flash lights and search dogs?  Whenever I played that as a kid, i would get my dog out of the house and let him go.  He would immediately go to my brother.  Best dog ever.

not all the time, obviously. Just when he has a problem with his self esteem.

In my Aural Skills I class we did listening exercises with professional ensembles. One time we sat down in class and the professor had put on an album full of klezmer, and the track currently playing featured a bass clarinet klezmer solo. It blew my mind.

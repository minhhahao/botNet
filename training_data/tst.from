No, it does.  That's why water is considered the universal solvent.  Ethanol won't dissolve sugar for example, which is why it messes up your engine when you pour it into your gas tank.
That's why you don't put anything on facebook you wouldn't want everyone on the internet to be able to see next to your name and face. Any other strategy is pointless.

Am I the only one that paused for a second and thought 'Wait.. would this actually work?'
True.  I've just never really thought of myself as 'pretty'.  In my mind, pretty seems like a feminine adjective.  And I think I'm rather masculine in my appearance--broad forehead, beard, body hair, the usual muscles male runners and cyclists get--that sort of thing.

Am I the only one that paused for a second and thought 'Wait.. would this actually work?'
True.  I've just never really thought of myself as 'pretty'.  In my mind, pretty seems like a feminine adjective.  And I think I'm rather masculine in my appearance--broad forehead, beard, body hair, the usual muscles male runners and cyclists get--that sort of thing.

She had sex with a guy, and then sex with his teammate only five minutes later in an SUV.  Her new name should be HERPES.
thanks  and yeah, these guys are reputable mechanics. I was over reacting I guess =/
I wasn't near my cave or spawn, I was lost.

You can craft them, but they don't have a special blueprint. You have to use the Slot Token + Class Token + scrap metal.
I'll try to translate  'dude gave me beads, I was trying really hard to be polite, taught some monkeys to joust and made a million $US'
like the bug report from the customer right?
Wood looks nice. You just have to learn to not set things on fire.
Funny, but lets see how long you survive if they decide to take you up on that.
WRONG. The magical unicorn was just a prophet, not a king. The magical Push Me Pull You was king. The Holy Dichotomy created the sunrises and mountain ranges when he spit into the void.
The fact that you want to learn klezmer makes you one of the coolest people on reddit!
I don't mean to be rude, but your concerns are addressed in the article. I recommend reading it.
Chambliss? Saxby Chambliss!?   *starts slow clap*
Fa shone.Tippin off da po po is a no no.
for  the  love  of  pete  in the name of the interwebs, i demand a full blog pictoral of your year adventure living on a boat in Alaska!
Actually, Garrison said that it wasn't strictly needed ! He just put it there!
For very simple to use design software, you might look at the Google Sketch-Up. It's not deep, precise, professional software like Max, Modo, Rhino, etc. but it is free, and it is easy to get started with: http://sketchup.google.com/
It is OK to say Fuck on here.
They had some footage when I started watching (After your comment), but they've switched to some soap opera shit or something. Seriously. There's an attempted coup and you're showing a soap opera? That being said, I'm not sure what station is being streamed in the link above. No hablo espaÃ±ol.
By fixing SMP stuff, he meant playing Civ V.  And honestly, power to him.  Am I disappointed?  Yeah, a little.  But I'll get over it and I'm not going to rage about it.
'Dawg' is racist, yo.
I saw the sippers and it HAD TO HAPPEN.   The best part was this one woman kept running into us putting the stickers on things. She seemed to think it was hilarious, though. 
Make sure to use bedrock! :D
And you had no idea before?  That's so interesting to me.
I had winter on vinyl.  You guys are just frauds.
If you pay for the class, you should be able to skip as many as you want and still get a good grade, provided you show mastery of the material. 
He mentioned it a few months back and then again [in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flGug8SRLWk#t=03m07s) a couple days ago. 
**GOD** **HATES** **HATERS**
Chill out and learn to take a joke. [](/dude)
And a good 6 Hours by mine
It wasn't illegal before this era. This is like the worst era.
no it's not
Good, let them think that. We have enough posers and asshats ruining WoW with all it's media attention. 
Even Harder.  Perhaps too hard IMO. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omtpEZvzlQE
So you're saying that companies that exist to live outside the means of government yet want to rely on all their infrastructure are not guilty of *THEFT?*  Interesting argument from a teacher.
It may be his cousin Al.
I think of it as a hedge bet that just paid off.
thats on the cheaper side of the hats too. 
Well, that's the thing, isn't it? Having that many would only make sense if you knew that you wouldn't have to worry about the aftereffects beyond the end of those 90 seconds you were drinking.   tl;dr - Your argument is invalid. 
No. It was silly. People here act like there is only one state in the US.
You're saying this isn't your favorite flavor of thread?
No mention is made of a patent license for whatever patents Google has on this.    Kind of strange.
I don't think so, I've found iron near coal fairly often.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods . Here you go.
I hope you mean give way to the right and just translating to American, otherwise you'll be in for some fun accidents.
Babe, you can look at all of them on my phone this weekend. They turned out pretty good, how could i have not put them up =P  This weekend will be one to remember hun ;)
Definitely Massive Attack: Mezzanine. That album is a masterpiece.
Because they're lossless PNG versions of the WebP images. Your browser can't display the actual WebP versions.
If you turned around right this very second and you saw a beautiful mysterious queen coming at you with a bowie knife, what would you do?
I don't want to buy her a new kit. I'm not gonna promote this in any way. I am concerned for her health but not enough to buy her fucking needles and shit to shoot up with.
yes, i am
Man, if I had a brandy snifter, I would raise it to you and toast our never having to go back to college again.
Shut up, witness!
My daughter, after ten long years.  But I'm sure you put the twenty to good use.
Post a sample of how yours sounds!
You deserve more upvotes for this reference, [seriously.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law)
It would entertain a judge and it isn't like the guy murdered someone. It isn't outrageous that this could exist, however, I believe it is fake.
Sorry I had to go to my friends house to get some beer. Yes I am wasted. WANNA COME OVER BABY??!?!?!
I don't give a fuck if he plays only 1 game all year. he's still my favourite player.
I feel like there's more room to compromise on that. Chocolate or vanilla, that's pretty black and white.
**HE STILL CAN'T HEAR YOU BECAUSE THIS IS TEXT AND NOT AUDIO**
Except on Earth you can circumnavigate the globe. Not so on a tidally locked planet. it'd take a lot longer to figure out the planet is a sphere.
your response prevented me, thanks!
The guy has been battling some pretty nasty illness for a while. 
I can see eggs from my kitchen.
'What most bother me is that after being prepared the defense that much they finished scoring a goal'.  Doesn't have that much sense but is what it says.
Pulling out the Plato!
OH MY GOD. For a while there I had forgotten that we're all descended from Lee Adama.
He was a senior lecturer, at least he was in the damn building, unlike O'Donnel. Didn't she also lie about graduating Princeton? 
I work at Kings Island. When it was called the Krusty Krab Snack Shack, outside concessionaires ran it, and it never actually sold hamburgers...
You wanted criticism... this is just a technical one.  Lowest model settings (graphix settings) is probably a bad idea while you're casting.  Thanks for doing this though!
Actually, you really don't want the middle of a human centipede.
You seem... *unsure.*
I'm an Andalite, yes, that would be it.
We could build a Rama ship. I'm like half way thru the book, so I don't know what happened there.
But I know fists are fun!!!
how are those nipple rings treating you?
Is it Friday night already?
Vixen is pronounced like the German word Wixen - which means wanking. Foxy.  Russ Meyer, too.
Can you imagine the uproar that would have caused? 'Harvard gives false hope to patients blah blah blah.' They probably didn't want that to happen.
you got it bro
-hangs head- I was cruising new submissions....
Uh, what? That is completely inapplicable in this situation.
Season 7 episode 2
CALL THE COPS HES TAKING PICTURES OF KIDS TO POST ON THE INTERNET. à² _à² 
I'm not aware of this fake Majora's Mask thing.  Would you be so kind as to share?
Nah, that's just centaur porn.
No, you're thinking of Mr. Clean. Lance Armstrong is the guy that went to the moon.
In the long run, it's her choice and they should respect that.  There is no woman in the world I can think of who would be *happy* about this news after a year of dating.  
Yeah, Frank fell asleep so we shoved a carrot up his ass.
Alternatively, set the crouch to caps-lock.
Yeah, the douchebag who called Max Cleland unpatriotic.  What a fucker.  This is nice but doesn't redeem him entirely.
'Dammit, I'm Rochelle again!'
I said this the last time this same question was asked.
Ah, thank you.  I forgot about genetic drift.
I have good news, actually.
[](/wetodddog)
FUCKIN A man... that is an understatement.
I have 90 seconds to live. AMA.
Didn't I? 
For anarchists, they sure do love their government benefits.
I don't know why you're being downvoted. This is clearly a Leibniz-Euler diagram.  Happy birthday, by the way.
how many hours of tf2 do you play a day?  what's your total # of hours?
*Fox use lick attack!*
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's understandable if you didn't find this funny, but a Redditor should never stoop *that* low.
That doesn't mean you should stay home on election day.. Voter turnout will make or break this proposition.. nay, history!
Shortened URLs through this service aren't supposed to be remembered. 'goo.gl/A23D4' isn't as rememberable as 'domain.com/keywordOrThree'. To tell you the truth, outside of Twitter, I don't see cryptically generated short urls as all that useful.
That could be true as well. Remember we spread chicken pox on blankets?
Sex toys. Dildos really should be nothing but medical grade silicone. 
You stay busy as hell with that screen name don't you. I've seen you on different threads all over the place.
I've only played TF2 a couple of times. What do hats do, other than look funny?
######I think all terrans will make a raven in the future vs Zerg. ######as Zerg gets better at creep and baneling mines. Terran will just fuck all that up &gt;: &gt;:&gt;:

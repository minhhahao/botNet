## About
An NMT based on seq2seq for translating language
- Dataset:  
  * [anki](http://www.manythings.org/anki/) to provide translation from any language to English
    - Currently using [Spanish-English](www.manythings.org/anki/spa-eng.zip)
- Algorithm:
  - Tensorflow's implementation of [seq2seq](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt)

## Woking in progress

-   [x] Processing RAW JSON file
-   [x] Finish the database
-   [x] Setting up training dataset
-   [x] Creating training model from scratch with [tensorflow/nmt](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt)
-   [ ] Create a website to interact with the translation model

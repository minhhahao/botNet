Cameron.
Why?
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Hi.
The "real you".
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Daddy, I --
I'm missing something.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
How many people go here?
Will Bogey get bent?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What 're you talking about?
Hey.
Nope - just came by to chat
William didn't even go to high school
What'd he say?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
You -- covered in my vomit.
You know who The Raincoats are?
You don't care if I die
And I'm in control of it.
Were you in jail?
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Who?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
So what did I have an effect on ?
A soft side? Who knew?
So what's your excuse?
Tell me something true.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
What?
It wasn't like that.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
Parts of it.
Which parts?
Macbeth, right?
Right.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
What's to discuss?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Your life, and that of others!
I could be gone for years.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
What are you listening to?
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
He understands.
That's what it says.
Esdras is a Jew.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
We don't need to know.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Where can I meet this man?
You think I don't know that?
We're lost!
You bloody...
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
I'm coming with you.
You bring the cigarettes?
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
What's your cut?  How much?
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Now I become custody of police department?
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
In the kitchen.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
I let her take a shower.
End my career?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
What's he looking for?
Yeah.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Nah, I musta missed it.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
Pretty.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
So...who's Nicky?
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Hey, honey.
I'm not.
That's unique.
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Give me the address!!
Is there a problem?
Don't speak Russian!
Speak English!
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
Why not?
What is that?
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Traitor!!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
As a plumber?!
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
A cheap hotel.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Mouth's clean, too.
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
How was it?
Get outta here!
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
CONTINUED
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Yes, I know.
CONTINUED
CONINUED
Are you coming to my party?
When are you coming home?
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Fortunately, they did.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Certainly.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
I see.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
That's true
Roger.
Hey, what about me?
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
Bullshit.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
What do you think?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
There.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
We missed.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
Yeah.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
A cop...
I don't think your gun's loaded...
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
What'd you do?
I guess he got the message...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
That's the way I see it, too.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Hey, two days with him is enough.
How hot are they?
Can't complain.
Yeah, old times.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
You sure?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
So you do know her.
She's an exception..
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
What's she doing?
The Fifth Element...
Hello?
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
He's on vacation.
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
...Shit!
I thought you were divorced.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
Where you going?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
Exactly.
Not going to open?
Been here long?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
Staedert, do you read me?
Wait or act.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Your clothing reeks of it.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
... What's going on?
What happened to you?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
What the fuck... !
You said something about money.
Is it?
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
I'd rather you didn't.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
I'm not so sure about this.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Celebrity Films.
I want his name.
Something like that.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Give me the film.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
I'm telling you it's not that.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Yes, but...
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Will you let me look?
Hello... ?
I remember.  You just left...
What are you talking about... ?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Who are you?
Okay, I'll take it all.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
What?
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
We have matching luggage.
That obvious, huh?
No...
How long have you been awake?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
I was afraid you weren't coming.
Where are we going?
Alice...
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
You do good work, Alice.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
They think I'm nuts.
But I've seen her grave.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
But if they <u>do</u>?
Reef!
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Right <u>at</u> him?
What?
That's a <u>face</u>???
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Who?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
I hear Twombley got shot.
He's on to us!
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
We bought you.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
This way.
Where'd you get the blood?
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
Sure you did.
What?
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
I don't care. They're out.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I called Mommy.
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Okay.
You're a policeman.
Don't go playing policeman.
Huh?
You mean Twombley?
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Yeah. A few things.
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
What do I have to do for it?
So?
You and Mel Gordon?
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
The key, Wade.
See. Get your boots.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Something about my father?
Jack?
The other guy.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Just do it.
Rolfe.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Then who shot him?
I don't know. You tell me.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
Mom?
Yes dear?
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
It's cut.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
We don't know that.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Because it is my duty.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Nine.
We're not going to make it.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Stop.
You'll do it?
There goes your ride.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
You know what?
I miss you. And I miss her.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
How did your speech go?
I don't know why you stayed.
Excuse me?
What's going on?
We're under attack.
This is the President.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Shepherd.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
I was reading too.
Te...!
Elaine, what happened to us?
Who's that, Ted?
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Simon.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Request; life support systems check.
Scraps.
He's a boy dog.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
He's carrying a bomb.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
Ted!
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
I love you, Elaine.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Rain.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Good-bye, darling.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
I'm Randy.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Roger.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
He's not here.  Why ask me?
You don't have squat.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
Let's talk Hubley.
Nothing.
What is this?
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
I believe he is probably lying.
Yeah... I know the routine.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
But there's no more drug.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Position?
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
Now, wait a second --
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Alive?
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
What's this?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
It's inside the complex.
You're just reading me.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
Thanks.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Terrible.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
In a harem.
What's that?
What does he look like?
You were sublime.
Extremely clever.
Oh - excuse me!
What??
You have leave to try.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Eat
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
Why not? Half the house!
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Who was that?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
How much will you pay him?
Am I interrupting something?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Be careful!
He's adorable!
Gertrude!
It's just a trifle, of course.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Sire.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Yes?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
And German?
Excuse me, but how old are you?
I have no idea.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Do you always live like this?
How is your financial situation?
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Oh, thank you, sir.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
What for?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
I'm sorry. No.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Really?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
What happened? Is it over?
Where is your wife?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
You mean she's not coming back?
I think so.
You go fast!
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
Here in Vienna.
Well?
All Vienna has heard that.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
You mean that play?
Yes.
Are you absolutely sure?
I've seen the manuscript.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
About the ballet.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
What does he want?
Herr Salieri.
Yes, I am looking after him.
How did he look?
Oh, Miss Price?
He said 'Jack'.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Did he say a wolf?
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Yes.
David says Jack comes to warn him.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
He's here.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
What shall we do?
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
How is that?
Call me Alex.
How old are you?
How old are you?
Yes, go on.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
I was dreaming again?
Bathroom.
Do me an enormous favor?
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
David, what are you doing?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Who is this girl?
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
Where am I?
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
She's a jerk.
I don't know.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Come on, where?
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
We were attacked by a werewolf.
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
No, thank you, Doctor.
What can we do to assist you?
Do you have any hot soup?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Matt?
Whose death?
Mr. Dickson in yet?
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
We want to talk to you.
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
What is?
Doesn't that come next?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
No.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
The theatre?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Good morning.
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Mr. Sampson . . .
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
He's at a board meeting.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
No.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
What did you do with it?
Oh, Matt . . .
Did you talk to him?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Everybody in?
He's smiling.
What have you done?
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
He's planning a job.
I think I recognize you.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Sure, cousin.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
I got us through the War all right.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
You know you're welcome any time!
Daddy, don't start with this again.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
You're doing just fine.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
That just might work.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Ma! Please!
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Sparkling rocks?
Don't swear.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
How can that be?
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
How did you know?
So he's won.
In English, Pinkerton.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Courtney? Dinner?
Nice?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Is it a what?
It's a plain end. I think.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
Nothing like last time, promise.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
I want a firm commitment.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Listen, what about dinner?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Call me please, Patrick.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Sorry. 
Where are you?
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Had his apartment been burglarized?
That's so typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Yes.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
I lost my job...
I'm not...
It's...it's...all right.
Oh well, you know.
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
You are a fanatic.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
That took some fun out of --
He's your boss. He's not your --
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Isn't that -- extreme?
Teddy was killed last night.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
What?
...What?
...wanna savor this.
Milo?
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Is it your software?
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Did you?
You look a little tired.
'Have a look?
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Let's go.
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
But why would they --?
They'd frame him.
How close are you?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Does he know you know?
Why?!
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
That kid's the great white hope.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
I don't get it.
Why?
I am not.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Austin, what's your point?
Lay it on me.
Danger's my middle name.
Is it one of ours?
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Shut up.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Sea bass.
Right.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
What did you say?
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
He's asleep.
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
We don't judge here.
And how do you feel about that?
... love ...
Would that I could say the Same.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
People, too.
Who?
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
You.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
Too many cooks --
But -- why?
Rules are made to be broken.
And just what is the game?
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
And I suppose you're the knight.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
For a man in my position --
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Orders.
I'm playing to win.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
You lied.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
You first.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Our chaperon.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
I see.
Who's now vanished.
Steed
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Insane ... ?
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
The last one you'll ever see.
You said ... one shot.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Five thousand dollars.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Great car.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
No, Cole, I...
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
It looks awful.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
This is it, lady. Last stop.
I don't believe you.
Let's get naked.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Hookers beat you up?
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
You want to share it?
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Oops!
Rick!
Ed... you're kinky!
Where'd she go?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Very.
Reach out and snort someone.
My Debbie?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
You're late again, Rick.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
I don't know.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
-- He killed people --
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
-- I told you to stay next to me!
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Hey.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Brian. What's wrong?
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
Oh Jesus Christ...
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Are you still here?
Where are you going?
Are you going public with this?
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Brian?
Yeah. Big fan.
No need to be modest, Brian.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Management were pin heads.
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
We gotta roll, Stevie...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
Shadow.
-- Burn them.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
"Don?"
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
You took the chalice.
I forgive you.
Let me think about it.
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
What money?
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
Keep trying.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
You don't have the demographics.
What do I do?
What do you do?
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
My tap shoes.
How different?
I would like to change your name.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
I've never been given a fair shot.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
I want to speak with you.
Where do you go from here?
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Manray!
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
What point is that?
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Light?
Hi, Mona.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Regardless, he still is your father.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
How did you get this gig?
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
I never had a really real pair before.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
I thought you got rid of...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
...not that time...
...perfect...
I fell out of my bed last night.
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
I don't know who I am.
And?
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
And so I am.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Who else can give me information about you?
I believe they will deport you.
Certain?
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
Why are you shaking?
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Charming Schuvaloff.
He is only curious to know who you are.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
You framed-him...
You killed him you fucking faggot --
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
I didn't shoot West --
I apologize --
You saved Kendall's life --
We don't need the tapes --
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Sir, yes, sir!
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Mueller.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
What don't you know?
Is it the truth?
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
I didn't --
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
And the problem is you only got three.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Nevertheless --
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Hostile and uncooperative.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Good cop/bad cop?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
Watch me.
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
We need to talk --
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
No one else heard it?
Dunbar says you were.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
What happened with Nunez?
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Yes!
Who is she? Where does she live?
Then do it.
How would you describe him?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
How old are you?
Eighteen.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
Karl.
I will.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
The river.
Oh.
Daffodils?
Wait! I need those!
So what are you up to now?
Oh. Oh.
Are you Jenny Hill?
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
I talked with your father last night.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
How is he?
Of course.
That really happened?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
You know what for.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
What? What are you doing?
Leave him!
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Oh.  We are Russian.
Right.
No.
What was that?
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
She says she has a secret to tell.
I...
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
Do you believe in love?
I understand. I'm so sorry
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
I'm so sorry.
They go. John. They go.
So what are you going to do?
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
What?
What?
Oh Jesus.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
You don't have to say anything
Please, there's no... Oh.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I don't have nothing.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
It's a long way to go for a date.
My name's Sophia.
You hurt it?
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Hey.
Yeah.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Better?
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Teh... Tehronne?
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Don't need none.
How you let men treat ya like they do?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
No ma'am.
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Uh-uh.
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
I can handle that.
You take it straight?
Could you do somethin' for me?
Tell me what to do.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Sorry.
Looks like you know a song.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
This ain't gonna work.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
Why?
Who do you think the Jap is?
Frank Abolofia.
What'd you say?
Nick, we can't just --
Getting very weird.
Connie...
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
You must leave?
Yeah...
Know her?
What's he saying?
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
I'm not drunk...
What's in the box?
Nick, you can't do this.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Don't be an ass.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
He drinks.
What do you chant?
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
I still think you're a bastard.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Guess I'm on a roll.
What...?  What if I say no?
Could you fill me in?
You trust me?
With these?
You want him dead too.
Then go get him.
What's the problem?
Show me something?
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
When do you deliver your project?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Next.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Those cockroaches?
How old am I?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
I'm doing okay.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Yeah?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
What night?
I don't know nothing about it.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
This feels stupid.
Thanks.
Yes.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
If she is, the machine works.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
What?
A tortoise.  What's that?
Know what a turtle is?
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Hi!
You like it?
How do you do?
You're lost?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Dickhead?
What's wrong with you?
I just had a mental picture of...
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
And that's it?
Yes.
Why are you doing that?
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Doing what?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
How long would you need me?
Who are these people?
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Yes.
One who's not a mutant.
Yes!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
May I please be excused?
About clothing?
I certainly do!
No it's not!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
That's ridiculous.
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
What?
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
Hi, Eve!
...I do.
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Your mom made that all by herself.
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
That's what everybody believes?
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
That's right?
Yeah.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Yeah?
Not on him.
Almost all of them.
Does that work?
The hotel.
Whatcha looking at?
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Hello.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll be all right.
Right.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
You got a light, honey?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
How long will we have to stay down here?
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Home sweet home!
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
You have tranquilizers?
What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
No.  I think it's just right.
Yes!
Right here!
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
If we still have one.
Mutants?!
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
He's smart.
How long will you set it for this time?
I thought ten years.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Well, what do you think?
That water's freezing!
He go back to the hotel?
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Where are you going?
Gay.
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Nobody.
I, I don't know.
Yes.
See my nipples?
I made it go down the toilet.
Do you know?
No.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
No. I should go.
Come in.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
You like to open me, don't you?
Come on Dorothy.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
There's no disease, I can tell you.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Don? Where is he?
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
No thanks.
There ya go.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
That sounds great!
Well.
Hi Dad.
That's too bad.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
You want to tell me about it?
Okay, okay.
Goodnight.
I'm really sorry.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Everything okay?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
No.
I should go with her, Sandy.
Go ahead.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Fuck you.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Look again for fuck sake!
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
What are you going to do?
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
Absolutely not.
I'm serious.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
That was way easier than I thought.
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
It is your corrupt we claim.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
My, my...
What about one guy with two guns?
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
Promise me boys.
What are you serious?
What the fuck do you mean?
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
You believe?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Open it!
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
What does Starsky say?
This is he?
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
Did you see that?
It had an alarm.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
You think we're going to be chased?
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Where's the manager?
I'll say it.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
She's from Cuba.
He's gone. He stole the car.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
I wish I'd been there.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
That's what she is!
Shut up!
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
You could give somebody a concussion.
Eleven fifteen.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
I don't know.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Where's Kumar?
There's not enough time.
Like amnesia.
You got to be kidding me.
How big is it?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
Did Dignan take the test?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
See you.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I hope not.
No, I don't mind.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Yeah.
No.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Are you a fag?
It's true, Dignan.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
The guy is fucking insane.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
His name was Swifty?
My brother's in jail.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
I don't know.
Yes, I do.
Come on in. What you been up to?
I never agreed to that.
Everything OK?
What's that?
Yes.
Well, I think --
Is that your chiquita?
Got a little lucky.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
I want to know what happened.
...this is Conklin's computer.
Do you know what his budget was?
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Why not? It was just money.
What do you have, Danny?
And?
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
Front. Use your teeth.
I don't know.
I don't know who that is.
I'll get the book.
No. There's nothing new.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
It's just a nightmare.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
We can't wait to be sure.
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
Yes.
What is this, a game?
Say it.
I killed him???
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
My first job.
It's me.
Don't need it. I remember everything.
We need to get in there.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
Looks like he's been detained.
This is everything? Is there.
It's a lot of money, Pam.
Who's this?
How long have you worked for the agency?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
And why is that?
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
Young Robert, we are honored --
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
The Scots will fight for us?
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Stephen ready?
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Did it work?
I... accept your proposal!
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
I've missed you.
How do you know this?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
I am the Princess of Wales.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
You will die! It will be awful!
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
And the bad news?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
Straight up.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
What time is it?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Listen to me good, Evan...
I come from a big family.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Lenny? Come on!
Does he know that?
Er, goodbye, sir.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Do you know where they are?
What are they?
No.
Yes?
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
But what about us?
It's been a long time.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Be careful.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Ask me?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
And I congratulate you.
Thank you. I try.
Good morning.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Yes. What is it you want?
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
I believe you have a message for him?
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
A leader, like Laszlo?
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
Yeah? What's his name?
He is traveling with a lady.
I have my orders.
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, no, Rick never --
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Oh, thanks.
You're late.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Give me another.
What is your nationality?
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Good. Then have a drink.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
You're beautiful.  Marry me.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
Why do they have to die for me?
It's real.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Oh?  You've tried?
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
What brings you out to the sticks?
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
I have to.
No.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Is that Jango?
What's that?
Yeah?
Come on.  Try.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
I love you, Chuck.
Which I didn't have.
If you say you are.
Don't you even think about it.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Kamal is not here.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
And never take.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
That's all there is.
What, then?
Thanks.  For everything.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
These *credentials* are against the law!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
So, Mrs...
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Where's Mandalay?
What's the *medical* explanation?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
I *know* this was right.
*What* will be okay?
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
"...did." Well, okay.
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
But did you know him?
What's a nanny do?
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
What's that? What's it called?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
I haven't read that.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
It's just my heart.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
Who cares?
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Can --
The standard ten.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
The Anti-Christ?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Just the last three weeks.
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
Eight A.M. flight.
So that's it...
You can't cheat an honest man.
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
No thanks. I'm good.
I think I just broke my hand.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
What about Customs?
Don't worry about it.
Why?
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
What about what?
No, I want my cut!
Meet me at my place later.
What?
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
I'm sorry.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Sorry. What?
Aces, Suits.
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
Still time.
I can imagine.
What kind of deal you looking to?
What?!
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
How did you land that?
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
I loved it blond.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Probably.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I'm on at nine.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
You will?
You were talking in your sleep.
How did you know I was here?
I hate public transport.
Found a job?
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
Oh hello.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
How did you hurt your hand?
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.
I can't do it, Jani.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Hello...
Who...
Of course I recognised him!
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Who are these guys?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Does Bella come here?
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
You use two alternating, don't you?
Where's the magnet?
Five.
What for?
You can start Monday week.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
Bruised.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Key?
Where is it? What did you do with it?
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
It is intuitively obvious.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
Must get lonely being up here so much.
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
That's correct, sir.
Who are you?
Oh, yeah?
No?
I'm on a break.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Who's Camille?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
What a creep.
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
I don't want to move away.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
The other ones?
The other one like you...
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
I think you should go now.
Thank you.
Then what?
Nothing on Hannah?
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
That's odd...
A long time.
Unlikely.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Catch you back at the wall.
Hey, Sketchy--
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
You left out condescending.
But there's another side--
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
And why should she?
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
I was on call. 
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Hawk.
What's that?
Beth? I can't believe it.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
You got in the car, didn't you?
One more time in English.
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Go ahead, Jam.
They're not idiots.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
I said, I'm sorry!
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
How old is Grandma Death?
Don't look so freaked.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
We're moving through time.
What's wrong with you?
Will you please talk to me?
Hey.
Where is she?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Grandma Death.
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Where are you going?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
I don't own a television.
He said to follow him.
I asked you about school.
Who is the boss?
Four times... so far.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
I can see him right now!
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
Kitty...
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Ow!
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
What?
This here's Loretta.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
That bitch from...
All right, then.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
Gladys! Stop it!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
The king can do to wrong! 
"My dear"...
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Yankee Poodle.
That was for you.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
What do I get?
She did.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
How'm I doing, boss?
Are you getting tired?
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Once more! 
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Oh, would you...?
So that's the one you want to marry.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
You won't be long?
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Hmmm?
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Yes sir.
Good! How is the patient?
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
Don't we?
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
How are you feeling today?
You never mentioned his mental state.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Is he... dying then?
You alright?
Thank you... very much.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
Yes!
My name is...
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
You look splendid, John.
Ohhh...
Yes John?
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
A dressing bag.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Pardon me?
Please! Please! What are those?
What are what?
What's the matter?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
"The fifth one this week"!
We mustn't let him land!
Halfdan the Black.
Just give me a hand.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
I shouldn't have come.
I see the world.
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Scream.
Why should you care?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
I know!
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
So?
You need to say a bit more than that!
I think we should go...
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
Well, what else do we do?
ROW!
She hasn't got any.
I came to find my grandfather.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
You're wasting your time.
No, I'm not.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
Well! Come on!
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Wasn't it, Keitel?
You've lost your mind.
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Thorfinn! You can't die!
No... he's not... not... there...
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
And I just liked you so much.
You were not.
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Why?
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Frost?
Thanks.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Where are you going?
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
So, um --
No, it isn't that.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Oh?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
What was I wearing?
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
But you weren't. I could tell.
I dropped you off after. You said --
Probably.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
You said...
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I think, before.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
What if you stay this time?
So you'll call me, right?
When?
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
I can't stop thinking about you.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
It was snowing.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
See you later, alligator.
You found us okay?
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
He's coming?
What's this?
I know what it is.
It's no big deal.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
Stan? What's going on?
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Just wanted to let you know.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
I know who you are.
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
I don't.
Where are the others?
What is Debbie's position?
No, I guess not.
Going north?
Are you in show business?
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
Ballast.
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
We have a man down...
What?
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
What's wrong?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
What's on your mind?
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
How do you know all this?
Patch me through to him.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
No one?
It's complicated...
You have something, Dr. Weir?
The date.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
What are you?
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Captain Miller...
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
What is it, Starck?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
What?
First time in a grav couch?
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Explosive decompression.
Yes.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
What do you want, Vic?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Ben. Are you okay?
We had a tough year.
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
And they're changing into...
So are you!
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Now what is up with that?
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Apparently I can disappear.
I, uh, think I remember the number.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Yes, thanks.
For science.
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
Are you kidding?
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
But I'm not done with the machine --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Raising the shields.
You said it was urgent.
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
You want to work at Carl's?
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Yes, sir.
Jeff you have company!
Do you have any ice tea?
So are you.  Are you shaking?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
No.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
Damone. It's Mark.
Did you go home and get it?
And they don't call my parents?
How often do you go?
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
Who's that?
He is.
Naw. Any good?
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
He was hot, wasn't he?
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
What do you think it is?
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
Where's Doug?
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
What can I get for you tonight.
Where do you feel like going?
How about the point?
Are you really nineteen?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I had a really nice time tonight.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
What's April 16th?
I made a fool of myself.
Hi, Mark.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
What?
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Shoot it.
What are you talking about?
That's good...
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
That's what gives me The Fear.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
I want to leave fast.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
NO! Stop talking like that.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Adrenochrome...
You'd pay me for that?
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They'll be back.
Yeah.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
I don't think you should...
What?
Your brother, huh?
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Oh.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
How many?
Max?
Nine?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Welcome back.
Got 'cha!
Fine, Chief.
SHIT.
Get to your cars!
Oh my God... What is that?
We all have to be strong, right?
Are you lying to me?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
I'm not!
I'm not!
Huh.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Who?
A rich actress.
In my eyes, officer.
Who?
Fired?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
...Yes.
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
No.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
Bread?
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
I'm going back to the hotel.
Address?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Are you an actor?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Then don't go to Hollywood.
Okay then...
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
How ya doin', Farmer?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
I know what ability you're interested in.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
What'd you do?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
How's it sound?
But they're using you!
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
I think I need a little air.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Mama...?
Haven't you heard what I said?
You're not going anywhere!
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
I don't believe so.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
Please sit down...
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
This whole thing is a joke!
You're telling me you feel guilty.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
Symington says...
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
What?
Yes.
And he drove me to mine.
Nice.
People can be kinder than you think.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
There is something I want.  A friend.
Friend?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Must've been a terrible row.
And you?
I wish to be your wife.
You make me weak.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
A warming wind.
They just caught the man who did it.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
Quite a place.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Why?
We should go now.
Any particular reason?
What'll you do when you leave here?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
What's the matter with it?
How come?
Sure.
You said we were special.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
I don't believe you...
Ha!
Whassamatta?
Cowboy.
Girls can't be cowboys.
I got to.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Have you ever been there before?
Why do you want to stop?
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
What about Kate?
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Then?
You too, preacher?
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
What's this stuff?
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I promise.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
What do you think Mom would say?
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
About two hours from now.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
No!
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
What?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
I don't know, you just passed out.
Really?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
They broke when you fell.
That's what you think?
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
That's what I hear.
I'm fine, sir.
None at this time, sir.
Across the board, sir.
I'm not sure what --
Entering my scan now...
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Should probably ask him that.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Come on, Montgomery...
O'Neil?
Sir?
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
Just a coincidence?
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Chances of recovery?
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
She's haze grey and underway...
So dump on me.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Jordan...
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
"Dad."
Should I be afraid?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Say again?  How many micks?
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
Darth Vader reads poetry...
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
I don't know.  Seems...
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Don't you think we have enough?
So you made it.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
I got pretty close.
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Five bucks.
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
What?
They didn't make it.
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
We've met before.
It's the French Secret Service.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Thanks.
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
What?  What?
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
Shut up.
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
We'd never have the budget for this.
What does the Omega 13 do?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
No, wait, are you-
Up.
What?  Up?
Structural damage at 68 percent.
Yes?
U.... What do you think?
How do you remember this stuff?
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
They're gone.
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Jason..
Clenched jaw...
Jason.. Can you hear me?
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Wait. What did you say?
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Former Commander?
It doesn't have eyes.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
The army can survive without me.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
That can't be.
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
How old are you, Captain?
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
What's your advice, Alexander?
I'm not sure.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Some things must never change.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Where... do those men come from, George?
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
So where's the money?
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Calm down, Bear...
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
He's around someplace.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Get something going there.
What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Karen? You okay?
You know Laurel Canyon?
You positive about that?
I'm working on a few things.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
I don't know.
C-18.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Have we met? I don't recall.
You mean, Leo?
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
Just a thought.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
What do you get out of this?
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
Really.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
He died.
Yeah. That was a good party.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
One we're producing.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Who told you that?
How? By taking my money?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Man, can you scream.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
I think it's not horrible.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Why not?
I'll be right back.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
I miss Murray, Harry.
Harry -–
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
You think the extra strain caused it?
What? You sure?
What's so great about Sweden?
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Maureen.
Roger?
You think that's funny
What other choices have we got?
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Did you?
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
What's this?
How long?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Stay away. Or else.
There's somebody else on this boat.
Epps.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
That much I think we've already established.
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
What do we do with him?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I think I see it pretty well.
I heard that.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
You've been out for about a day.
Better late than never.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Who?
What is it now?
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Hi... what's up?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
Or maybe not.
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
There he is...
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
Like what?
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Go ahead...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Hi.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
That's not even --
Go die, asshole!
...are you waiting for a bus?
Yes.
I did too!
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
NO!!!
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
Oh, right...
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
So is that your boyfriend?
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
You can open your eyes now.
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Wow!  What was that all about?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Oh, hi...
Really?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
What's the matter?
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
What?
I dunno, I...
God, Dana's going to kill you!
Yeah, well... me neither...
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
I don't know.
Why? What did she tell you?
That slut!
There is no reason for fear.
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
Don't they, though?
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
Shhh.
John, it will not be easy.
You mean nobody died?
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
That's very considerate.
Goddammit!
But of course yours worked.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
Nonsense.
Good news?
I do, actually; very much.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
No, you didn't, Frank.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
I'm not even good for me.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
That's quite a story.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Who are you going to call?
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
Should we go?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Get on with it, counselor!
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
What now, Brainiac?
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Who?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Aren't you glad we waited?
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Ready?  What is it?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
No.  They're just coming to me.
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Eight o'clock?
Hi, Louis.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
What?
Uh-huh.
I told you, I ...
Are you all right?
All right.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Is that a game?
I want you to have this. 
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
All right.  What is it?
Two wavy lines?
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
I'm always serious.
All right.  I'll try.
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
That's what you told me two days ago!
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
They won't break this one.
Caesar, ignore them.
I'm serious.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
He killed his father and then my family...
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
So I understand.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
The Senators admire you.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
I was summoned.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
I can see that...
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
Death is a very light thing for you.
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Aren't you eating?
No -- why should I?
What?
Is anything wrong?
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
-- really incredible --
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Did you say rape her?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
The day after tomorrow?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Yes I am.
Mr. McCleery?
What for?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I'm in the bathroom.
Could you bring it up?
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
All right then.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Yes.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Yes.
I think I'll go to bed.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
But they would! Don't you see?
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
He didn't see me.
What?
I haven't. No.
Yes.
Thank you.
Are you afraid of me?
Is this -- what?
That you're afraid --
Anything. Anything at all.
No.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
There isn't any.
No.
Not exactly.
But you don't hate him.
Is it?
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
At college.
Why are you asking me all this?
What kind of car was it?
Good.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
You're not.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Mrs. Robinson --
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
Go home now.
What have you done to her?
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
When I go off?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
You believe me, don't you?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Oh no.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
I'd like to hear it.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
HUH?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
Why?
Have you seen it?
Oh -- work!!
Of course.
Yes -- I'd love to.
Nothing -- only to be here.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
I want to be alone --
What?
So --
Shall I see you again?
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Very early in the morning.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
On the train?
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Ready, Kringelein?
I take five hundred.
I must have made a mistake.
And the child isn't coming?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
Everything?
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
A man might what?
Yes.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Moreover --
Moreover...
Can't you understand me?
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Miss Flaemm.
No -- now.
A thousand marks -- 
I had to arrange about the trip.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
I mean with the Manchester people?
All right.
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Your what?
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
Permanent damage.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Want a look?
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
But they must be! They cut glass!
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
So what's your story today?
What happened to your hand?
Why?
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Going somewhere?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
Just a few bucks.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
Uh-huh.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Scram. Go home.
I can't. I just left home.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
The long end. Big con.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
What happened to Cole?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
You were gone for a while.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Only the real stiffs.
Carter.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Checking out your place.
Nothing's missing?
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
What the --
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
No.
John, you can't help her now.
I'm okay.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
This kid just wants his freedom.
Are you going to leave, too?
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
This is madness, Wynn.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Who else knew I had the baby?!
I suppose.
At least we found the diamonds.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
This room is full of ghosts.
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Can I have the Cadillac?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
I'm liable to find anything!
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
Let's talk about it some other time.
Could have happened to anybody.
First Nagasaki--now this.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
How are you, honeybunch?
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What an awful sound!
You invited me.
Anybody home?
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Ask it!
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
Man and boy.
He worships Father.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Where did you get the poison?
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
Penelope!
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
What kind of exercise?
Who was it?
Nothing.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
Not at all.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Shouldn't you lie down?
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
I did?
You used to like it stark!
Breakfast?
Which one?
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
The doctor.
Yes.
And what is his most cherished possession?
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
Why not?
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
He cried.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Just one favor.
Blue soup?
Honor, I suppose.
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
I feel the same way.  What next?
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Are you've seen it work cures?
What for?
It died for your sins.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
I'm an honorable clown?
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
Cut me open.  Find out.
I've struck my blow.
No!
Don't shoot.
What are you going to do?
Who's dead?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Yes.
Something's made you sore.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
What's this?
That goes double for me.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
How did she lose her feet?
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Don't know.
My father!
Doing what?
Yes?
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
Is he all right?
The park!
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You're saying no.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
This is very good for us.
It is?
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
The what?
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Why would you do that?
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
Yes, we do.
No. I don't think so.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
Yeah.
That's cool.
I'm getting angry.
I don't know no Tod.
That's all you got, three girls?
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
No.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Joanne?
Something like that. How much do you make?
No.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
They are the same.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
She left you right?
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
They are?
Who made it?
What's it called?
The police? They know less than you do.
Yeah. Probably.
Get out.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
Is Marsha there?
How's your business, Jake?
What plan?
Hey man.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
Where's Ratan?
This is from the movie I was talking about.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
That's all right.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
I don't know.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
No.
Eh, Poli Sci?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Yes.
Come again.
Took it?
Then whose name is it registered in?
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
A block of ice.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Harold Chasen.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Over there by the courthouse.
Is he all right?
No.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
You are the wisest person I know.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Maude, do you pray?
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
But they'll put me in jail.
Just like this.
Do you think there is any life up there?
Yes.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
But why now?
It's true. I can't live without you.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Mother.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
I don't care what people say.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Just give me a rough estimate.
I don't know.
Your classmates?
What would you say?
You think so, sir?
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
The moment of truth.
Yes.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Stay where you are, Harold .
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Yes!
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
What's the matter with her?
I... I had a visitor.
And you're sure it was a woman?
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
I... remember.
Where am I?
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Who?
Is he serious??
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Don't look! Turn around.
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
That voice --
Those things never work. Never.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Yes?
What are you, a Boy Scout?
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Are you sure about this?
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Hi.
Just in time.
We've got such sights to show you --
Please listen to me --
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Oh.
There is going to BE a wedding?
Help me.
Later.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
So you were cheated.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
You can't love him.
Hi. I got soaked.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Which is where?
Is it deep?
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Maybe a brandy.
I'll be down in a minute
Just soda.
Well, isn't it?
No personal details?
This isn't the bedroom.
Who brought me in here?
Is Julia here?
Yeah.
...maybe we should never have come back.
He's gone.
I'm afraid it's true.
No you don't.
Where are you going?
You know I do know the way home.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
Meaning what?
Oh no.
If I make it through the day.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Yeah.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
What are you snickering about?
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Suck my ass.
What band?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Isn't it?
Like fuck you are.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
They always seemed...
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Hey, Barry.
Oh, hi.
Uh.  That's me.
Is there a difference?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Nice friend.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
I'll tape it for you.
I understand, Dick.
Rob.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
Are you coming home?
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
I think you know that.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
I haven't felt like it.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
Hello.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
You know I'm a good person.
Mmm hmm.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
When are you going back?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Laura...
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
But what?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Are you persuadable?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Enough of what?
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Yeah.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Nice.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Why?
This is against the rules.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
No.
No one knows you're here?
What's all that?
They do it each year.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
I didn't kill the watchman.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
Don't.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
What is it you want?
I'm calling an attorney.
You and I should talk first.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
I was driven out.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Who am I deceiving?
Finish your prayers?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
You seem to understand a great deal.
It can be different.  It must be.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
I don't know.
He knows I'm here.  How?
How are you?
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
Friend of yours?
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
It's all we have.
And if I refuse?
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Seventy-five.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
Too hot?
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
What's the matter?
I lost my wallet.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Hildy!
Mr. Burns --
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
No. My mother.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
How long would the interview take?
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Hildy!
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
You'll ask me to what?
Out of the mouths of babes.
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
What's the matter?
Where'd you meet this man?
He's in the insurance business.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Now you're talking!
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Exclusive? That's great.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Double-crossing swine!
What did you do with her?
What happened?
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
How was that for a tight squeeze?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Flip a coin.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Thanks.
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Who do you want?
He's on my phone. He just called me.
I think it is.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Goodbye, Yonson.
Little rum in yours, too?
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
Where'd you get this?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
For who?
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
What?
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
Where's the old lady?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Phone for you, Hildy.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
Okay.  Forget it. 
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
That's good.
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Isn't that her picture?
How'd you get here, Earl?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
How much do you make a week?
Who? Me?
You mean here in the city?
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
A very fine-looking women.
Get the cops, somebody.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
This is going too far, young man.
Give him the you-know-what.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I never was.
Bloody.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Won't they have maps?
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
You said that last year, Dad.
Who pays for them?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
They might be.
I don't know?
Weeds will grow, Mac.
What about it?
Except the servicemen.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
And absent bridegrooms!
You joined up.
Well?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
What is it, pet?
You're having me on, Molly.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yikes.
Cone.
Drink up, it's party time.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
What about the tree?
Hey, great they're back.
Can I help you with something?
Wondering what?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Keep straight on this road here.
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
What's he so excited about?
Should we stop?
Go around him.
What are you doing!
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
That's nice.
How long is that gonna take?
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Huh?
So.
So what?
When?
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
What was that?
Yeah, no mercy here.
God damn.
Keys.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
Get in... now!
Fit the profile?
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Wydell.
French?
Oui.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
What is wrong, my darling?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
Oui.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
You what?
I want to be the way I was before.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
You still in the market for a real boy?
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Nathan told my brother.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Oh, Rosie.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
We are animals after all.
Yes, darling.
Fifteen.
Yes.
That's very funny.
I think he's feral.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you?
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
How come?
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Should I come with?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Interesting.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
No, why?
Give me a bottle of beer.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
Hey, mister.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
I got drunk.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Now, when did you adopt me?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
What's that supposed to mean?
What's the matter? What happened?
When do I raise the bet?
Well, here it's half.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
Maybe. You want to play?
Well... well, now.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Fast and loose, man.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Yeah, that's what I think.
Findley.
There it is. I'm broke.
How much you playin' for?
You better not miss, friend.
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
Why did you do that?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Okay. So what's your name today?
Mm hmm.
I'm hungry.
Oh, cut my finger.
What's this supposed to mean?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Hundred dollars?
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
How much do you remember?
Do you remember where you lived?
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
We don't know that --
Have you looked inside?
What's inside?
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
Why, Dad?
There are more this year than last.
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
We were having a little talk.
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
Yes.
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
Who are you calling?
Damn.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
I have school.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
What do you want?
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
Are you all right?
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Then what?
They don't know this.
Not listed, huh?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
Nice meeting you.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
But Mr. President...
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
Grey, you read me?
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
It had been deemed classified.
It's doing what?
Really? You don't mind?
Yes, I am.
You know me...
Really? Ballet?
Oh. Sorry.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I shouldn't have left her.
Above American soil?
Can they be killed?
Air... water... your "sun."
Here... now.
Peace? No peace.
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Yes. Now we know.
Henry, the pen --
What?
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Schneider?
Are you expected?
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Bingo.
It must be one of these...
The Grail Diary.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
Don't call me that, please.
Through the library?
There were rats, Dad.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
They want my diary.
Will you take it easy!
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
And the chair.
Dad!
What?
This is intolerable!
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
Well... I can't think of anything.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Ready?
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
You think so?
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
You have insulted my son.
What's that?
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
Took what?
Couldn't keep away, huh?
WILLIE?!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Indy? Did you talk to them?
Anymore ideas...?
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
I get it!
Yes?
What street?
Yeah?
You'll be alive.
What was that?
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
I'll tell you what to say.
Outrun them.
Too late...They want you.
Thanks.
Sue them.
Take a left and your next right.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
I'm at the airport.
Now what?
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
What's happening?
What happened?
Without your pants.
Now, where would I be?
Get close to them.
What glasses.
He recognises you, throw him off.
It's not your time. I get time off.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
You sure this will work?
Dieter!
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
It'll remind me of you.
No!
Impossible.
PEM115!
...Foreign service.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
Oh...that's okay.
Oh...and who is it!?
And you.
That you're not crazy.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
...Naw. Made that up.
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you stay with me?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
This business is over.
What's he done?
We're very close.
You don't believe me.
Who was?
Ryuji and Gruner.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
You've  been there?
I know the territory.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
I'll come back for you.
You are, I've seen you.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Sure. Where?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
What are you cooking?
What caliber is my gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
No, no, we're fine...
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Hello?
I can take her.
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
Should I just take the documents now?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
You charge by the hour?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
You believe that?
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
Lowell, I can't afford --
I heard.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
What?!
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
ABC...?
You greased the rails!
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
He doesn't seem to be listening...
I can't say that!
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
Poor communication skills.
Object to the form of the question!
Chapter and verse.
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
You're in a rush.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Grounds?
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Got any symptoms?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
Thanks, buddy.
Marylin! What have I done?
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
Howard is a beautiful person.
Screw you, asswipe!
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
We're damaged goods.
I don't have a ring!
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
May I come in?
STUFF.  Got a light?
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
That's blackmail.
Hello?
It's a no go, Joe.
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Do you know him?
Every week --
Is this Ming?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
Well, that's about to change big time.
Wait. I know you.
Herb wants to see me?
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
...arty farty!
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Did Marylin end up with money?
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
Video.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Why don't you put me in chains?
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
Where are you taking me?
I'll get it annulled.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
You only met him once .
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
Oh, no.
Well!
Why? Do you know him? 
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me—and maybe we'll be friends—  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
What do they say?
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Who are you?
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
What's the matter?
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Of course it is.
You're crazy.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
What are you thinking about?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
What if nobody stops for us?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
You bet I did.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Don't "Joe" me.
You!
Yeah.
ain't got a hat—
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Mebbe.
See that. They're gone!
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
What's up?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
Why—no—
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Yeah. Just babies.
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Bill.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Go on, Willie.
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
Can you get some sworn statements?
Yeah.
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
...Oswald?
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
What?
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
For sexual purposes?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
You know who the mayor was?
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Was he there often?
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Germany.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
That sounds fun.
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
Why were you with him?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
Help us do what?
I gave you my card there.
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
I don't think so.
That doesn't sound dark.
Was she helpful?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Cash poor?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
What, I couldn't hear you?
The Delfonics.
He came by.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
I'm old enough to be her father.
I go back to work tomorrow.
They seem to like the idea.
Right around here, in the food court.
Will Ordell go for that?
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
Why?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
Did you do it that night?
The feds. It's evidence.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Spain.
Wanna go?
If I don't cooperate?
He say we like the same thing as married.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
He sells guns.
What for?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
She didn't say.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
Oh, hi.
Buy ya a beer?
He said he didn't know about it.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
It looks good on you.
Thanks.
Got some o.j.?
They asked.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
Baby, I didn't --
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
It's true, isn't it?
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
If you want.
No, I give it to someone else first.
Can you cover that?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I'll give ya ten.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
Man, I don't like that part.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
It's a diet thing?
No.
I don't like dancing.
You been to Japan?
Must of made quite an impression.
He went to meet that stewardess.
And your point is?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
I'm carrying it.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
This one.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
That's good money.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Who was that?
She believed you?
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
It's Louis.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
You know how she is.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Uh-huh.
So you're sure she's dead.
That's right.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Who's it for? A relative?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
House.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
You know who this is?
You still there?
I'm alone.
Winston found you.
Well, give it to me then.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
She was afraid.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
Uh-huh.
Take me home.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
I see.
Hello, Sam.
I'm okay.
Daddy!
You're hurting me!
That's right. We did.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
What do you mean?
Maybe the demons are real.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
You need ... a doctor.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
Her knee acting up?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She talk about the boys?
You should go back to her.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
Go to sleep.
Who did?
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
Jake, is that you?
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
You up?
Who? Jed?
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
You okay?
Where?
Show me Della!
What does it say?
How high is that?
While you were in the shower.
Why didn't you call me?
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Who was that?
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
I promise.
Sit down, Jake.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
You look upset.
Jake, what is it?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Don't be funny.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Oh God!
Goddamn you!
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
What is it?
I don't know.
Well that's good to know.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
Dream on!
Lennox Hospital.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Oh God. I know. I know.
The army?
I don't know. I don't know.
Can I help you?
Bring it in.
Duck fuckers?
Sergeant!
Where the hell were you?!!
Hey! I'm not ready.
Done!
Get them in the lab!
My job.
Not a chance.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
Fuckin A...
Where is everybody? What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
What if you miss?
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
Now that's just gross.
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Hurry! She's lost it!
What are you doing?
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
I missed you too.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Kicker!
The power's back up!
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Azrael can you repeat that?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
What?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
You got it.
It's my charter. My party.
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one...
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
Rogue?
He ate a car?
...Nothing.
Where'd you get all this?
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Christine what?
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
You wanna call it a night after here?
Yep.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut?  Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower?
20 feet, if it's an inch...
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
I don't like Katrina.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
We're getting a stretch limo.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Wait, let me take that.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Can we make out now?
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
Yup.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
When was this, like '96?
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
What is it?
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
What?
I heard that was you.
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Keith's hot.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
A Pilates machine?
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
What?
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Adele... are you serious?
What's Early been in jail for?
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Happy birthday Adele.
What if they're dangerous?
...I don't know.
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Tight fit.
Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
Brian.
How much do I owe you?
This the book your writing?
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
Sure.
So tell me... what happened here?
...and I think I know why.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
What are you going to do?
What about you?
Nervous?
...never?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
How old you?
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Yeah.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
What do you want?
Probably.
It is right.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
It's no big deal, right?
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Yep.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
Right.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Man, this guy is really good.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
What do ya want with Telly? That guy has enough bitches.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Right now?
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
Yeah?
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
I don't want you to hurt me.
What is it?
Why?
Why is that?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Wish me luck.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
And you don't get shit out of it.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
I hate 'em.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Yeah?
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Mom.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Yeah.
What's that supposed to mean?
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
I'm positive.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
You think he's dirty?
No shit!
How is she?
Why does he call Sanderson?
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Why not?
You know her?
It's you who's running out of time. You're starting to make mistakes now. You're wondering just how much I really know.  Just how close I'm getting? Well, I'm closer than you think, pal -- and I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
What word did you leave last night?
By that time the game will be over.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
What is it?
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
What about prints?
How long she been dead?
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
Just thought you might want to talk.
About what?
What do you see here?
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
No.
I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
Are we talking about me, or chess?
She could be dead after the game.
Why?
How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I know it was bad.
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
No.
What is this?
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
They're not delivering.  I'm going to go pick up the pizza.
I tried again and got through.
Hi.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
You beat him.
I'm not nervous.
Me too.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
We're almost married.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
You must move away from the Center.
That's a better one.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
Turold's son was to marry her.
The Fortress moves?
I cannot reach her.
She can see the Beast!
Use your sword.
Do not let the waters touch you.
Am I not worth returning to?
Let me comfort you.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
What kind of friend do you think I am?
We could reach it on fire-mares.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
Can't I come, too?
Sugarballs?
We meant only to please you.
You had better manners as a pig.
Food for crows.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A match for your son, I think.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
Can you see?
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
She has the power of vision.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
No, she was not as beautiful.
You had a son.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You will come with me.
No?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Huh... 500 meters?
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
It's incredible! How did you do it?
You were scared, weren't you?
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
No! I don't want to leave you!!
...Composer.
Can I sit on the stairways now?
No...
He probably just went somewhere.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
Why there?
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Why?
Doubts?  About what?
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
It has to be a full character's name.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Are they standing?
She knows you love her Mr. Parker. She knows now.
I need your help.
... My father.
No alcohol?
You're pretty drunk.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
You OK out there?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
How are you doing?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Will you lighten up, please?
There are limits.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Harvard Law School?
I have a 4.0.
Were you with another man?
Are we done for today?
Is he always such an ass?
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Huh?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
What are you talking about?
You're hitting on me?
I do. I'm not allowing it.
What?
-- his life?
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Relation?
Our group is full.
I'm a bitch.
You're pawning The Rock?!
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Josh proposed!
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
Okay, how would it work?
Whoa -- Why?
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
You go where?
You got into Harvard Law?
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Hovering?
Elle?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
Why?!
We come watch... we come watch...
My generosity is not so large as that.
Grotesque... monstrous...
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Kill me... I want... so nice...
You're a beast!
What was that?  Did you hear that?
You come stealee tleasoo?
No, wait... please... listen...
There must be an answer somewhere.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
This is ogre's magic.
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Nice piece of work.
God's blessing.
We'll find it.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Did you bring me here to sup?
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
You promised!
Sport, indeed.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Jack!
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
What have I done?
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Not very precise directions.
Is she fair, this princess?
I'd be honored.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Where?
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
And why was the alarm on?
I couldn't sleep last night.
Atonement.
Don't you have school?
What did you think it would be?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
He jumped into the ocean.
I can't even take a shower here.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
I can use your mom's.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
I was wondering.
I thought I was helping you.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Pardon me?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
I'm not.
Maybe that's too long.
She's out with a friend.
I'm sorry.
George, this is the third time.
I don't know.
Are you totally insane?!
It bugs me.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I know.  Why?
Sun glasses?
Left you this place.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Thanks for telling me.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
How many bedrooms will your house have?
A blueprint spool.
I love those doors.
One of you would end up dead.
Hey, hey!
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
I did say he could go.
I used to live here.
Where's Sam?
I'll find something that won't kill them.
It's been a while.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
Let's not do this, okay?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
Does Alyssa know?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He said he heard hammering.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
You never really trusted me.
Despite you.
You don't look like you.
You're sure about this?
Yeah.
Why?
Adam, that's not true!
She's doing just fine.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
I'm talking about a haircut.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Is Spanky here?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Yes, boss.
Comfortable?
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
You went to Monroe?
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
You need collateral.
Like this?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
So you made a generous contribution.
Winston. His name's Winston.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
No, man. I want you to have it.
You know what I'm saying.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
The hell you talking about? What train?
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
I said you're soft.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
You ever done time before?
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Mama?
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
You shouldn't have come here.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
That's what I thought!
...their damned souls will be ours.
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
So go get 'em, Dad!
That's a pretty brassiere.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
Hello.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
You missed something special.
Who invited you?
What's going on, Logan?!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
Six. I go red next year.
I let him go... believe me.
I wish I could help you.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
They won't believe us.
How will they know we're coming?
How do we know this is the right way?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Things change!
Beloved husband...
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Goodbye.
How long have you been living here?
What kind of place is this?
What makes you think so?
Where are they?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
I don't think so.
Pete... You okay?
Why not?
You know what I think?
Can I call you?
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Have you partied with him?
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
You liked it.
You got him.
We killed him.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
What night is that?
The police called us.
Did you tell the police this?
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
His physical condition.
No.
Where is he now?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
We know that.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
What is it?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
Let's go home.
What job?
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
How ya doin', Pete?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Where'd you come from?
Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Sheila... Stop...
Yes, sir.
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
That's ridiculous.
Yes.
No kidding?
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
The police?
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
What are we going to do?
Hey, what's happened to you?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Well - I'm—
To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including—  —the excess of virtue itself.
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
I surprise you? Now that's news.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Charming, isn't she?
Yes.
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
That's what you said.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
So you think I'm mad?
Oh, George . . .
You say the porters are waiting for us?
What about the others?
That fellow got on at Baskul.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!  George, something tells me our journey is just beginning.
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
I'd love it!
You'll wait till you rot!
Perhaps.
Hesitated, sir.
Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
I guess I lost:
No. just peace on Earth.
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
I wasn't scared...
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
So what's the problem?
I know, I know.  I read the manual. No attachments.  We work alone. Blah. blah.
Why?
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
What's going on, Kay?
The radio show?
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Nowhere.
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Where's he making his big speech?
No.  Follow him.
Where are we going?
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
What --
John?  What is it?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
Uh, sir...
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
If it's a question of authority.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
It seems I've found a flaw, John  You.
She's a precog?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I forgive you...
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
The precogs were wrong.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
The what?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
And how did Lamar become involved?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
Hold that thought.
You said they're destroyed.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
Tell him not now.
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
Since right after we lost our son.
No thank you.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
So?
What, sir?
Where's the place to go tonight?
Manhattan.
Holy shit.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
She's, uh, sleeping.
It's daytime.
Mommy's not home?
Honey?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Yeah? You sure?
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
I'll support you.
With what?
I said no touching.
Your dance is over.
5-5-1.
What's up? Jess ready?
You driving her?
What's his name?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Ruiz tied in out there?
Where's Ricky?
That it?
This is it.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
Yes.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
A bad heart.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
Nah.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Yeah?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Listen, man, we really gotta...
Ruiz isn't here.
I know the number.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
Who's driving her?
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Who you calling?
C'mon, man...
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
Nothing else.
Motherfucker...
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
You happy?
About what?
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
It was six in the fucking morning.
What do you have left?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
What about it?
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
Cardiff Giant?
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
He's on the list.
Yes?
Yes?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
Ow, shit...
No?
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
You're from LA, right?
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
We're square.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
What they call you?
When?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
Don't con me. Don't try...
Okay, okay.
Where am I gonna start?
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
Is the program ready?
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
It will be rough.
I'll be away a lot.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
That's right.
Can I ask you something?
Say what you're saying.
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
The sentences to run concurrently.
I ain't stupid.
How many you turning out?
How long has this been going on?
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
You want to be the head man?
Watch your tongue, boy.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
He's bright.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
[Why?]
[Who's the boss?]
[Where do I find him?]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
Yeah, right...
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
Creasy?
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Pinta...
Yes or no?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Time will tell.
Did you like school, Creasy?
No.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
It hurts.
Where?
Why do you ask?
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
Did you used to?
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
Could I ask you a question?
It makes it all seem so serious.
For a year?
[No. Why?]
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[I know this. Your point?]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
It's early.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
We just talked.
Who told you that?
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Oh.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Ufa!
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
Yeah.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Yes, I know.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
What?
I'll see you around.
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Put on your blue suit...
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
People will talk.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Ravenous. What about you?
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
We stand behind all our work.
It's in pretty deep.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
You're an attractive man.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Second pint.
I didn't have much choice.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
Excuse me, Sergeant.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
What's wrong with him?
He's coming to.
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
In the direction you want to go.
How much time do I have?
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
You don't aim to cause any trouble – But?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Yes!
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Ted Sheldon.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Money.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
The letter from John Doe.
What John Doe?
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Had any schooling?
Hello! . . . Yeh?
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
It makes no difference, Bert—the ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
Join the John Doe Club.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut and—I'll eat him.
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
That's got nothing to do with it!
Flowers.
Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
You want me to go up with you?
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
...a car.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Being faxed over now.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
You ever been in a hostage situation?
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
You don't like New York?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
I'm just practicing my lying.
How many have you lost?
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
I ain't interested in your life story.
Please. I'm begging you.
That a new picture?
Scott...
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Repoed this morning.
I can't do that.
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
Because I took it out of your memory.
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
Guests?
Only up there in the dream they called life.
And what about the reconfiguration?
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
You've got the keys, send someone in --
A hotel?
Try harder.
Insurance.
What's so funny?
Because you'll never believe me.
Male.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
What?!
Is this... food!
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Release the power with the power.
That's pretty bad.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
THREE DEGREES OFF THE COMETS TRAJECTORY!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
"Basically".
Anybody see them?
I am the mighty ape!
And I ain't no nigger either!
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
So Chicago's been good to ya.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
What do you mean?
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
I'm already late.
I was calling yesterday.
Who'll make the rules?
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Like a party for all our friends.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
He's trying to make it.
But that's an hour's drive.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
That's why I'm here.
Forget it. That's past.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
We were overdue to get hit.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
<u>Why</u>??
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
Bitchin' good cake.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
IT'S NOT WORKING.
You know ...  ... whoops!
You know, you never tell me anything.
What's wrong?
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
... Oh ...
Moscow.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
I see.  How much?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
You've never *seen* this contract.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
Looks like it, but--
It couldn't be.
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
You play--left field.
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Good idea. When?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
Tunnel?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Where?
What?
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
The war's on!
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
He's batty!
You'll see those committees when we're finished!
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
For one week!
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Here--where are you running off to?
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
It does!
Mr. President--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
No, Jeff--please--!
Yes, Ma?
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
Most natural thing in the world!
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
Oh, but this one is so simple.
A *day*!
Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
Calendar?
What?
He did?
You mean--here?
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
You win. It's--Clarissa.
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Not another bill?
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Oh--Saunders--
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
"I do solemnly swear--that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States--against all enemies, foreign and domestic--that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same--that I take this obligation freely--without and mental reservation and purpose of evasion-- and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God."
What! Who?
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
That's right.
Nice *compliment*!
What do you mean?
Well--me, too!
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
It's crucifying him--!
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Father--oh.
Mr. President...
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
That's going to be fun.
Who's that?
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
He's still pixilated.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
That depends on what they see.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
What's that?
The drums. He taught me to play some.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Uh-huh.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Had the boys follow us.
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Come on, come on!
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
You try it.
How's it going? Okay?
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Is that the best you've got?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Sit over there, will you?
Hang up.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Where?
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No, thanks.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Nah.
I've got one for Cobb—
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Arthur wants to quit!
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
I'm Chairman?
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
Naturally.
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Proceed.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Uh-huh.
Binge?
Who are they?
Where is your farm?
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Hey, did you hear that?
Shall I call the police, sir?
Me more than most.
How did they threaten you?
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Thank you.
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
No?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
Do you want to come in?
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
We've been talking about her, mostly.
A little.
What do you think's wrong with her?
...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
I'm sorry, your honor.
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Don't need it.
Can you help Mom?
I'm trying.
Do you think that's a good idea?
No.
Maybe you'll catch it.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Be specific.
Sore throat?
I can give myself a headache instantly.
Is that like a party trick?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
So whose route is this?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
Either one.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
That's one way to put it.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
What was that?
You feel violated?
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Where was this?
Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
Hey, Skip.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Damn! What is your name?
You were messed up, man.
How'd you do it?  The new you.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Relax, I got him.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Yeah?
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
A bright good morning to all.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
No.
Yeah, I was there.
No, I mean --
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
For what?
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
It's everybody's problem!
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
Except for one little thing.
And what's that?
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
So who killed him?
Much less go outside.
We could really use some coffee --
Who are you?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
What did he mean?
Doctor Heller?
They always call the great ones nuts.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Sure -- I guess.
Come here.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Alone tonight?
Roy.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
Oh don't start that again --
We had an off night, that's all.
And it would be the right thing to do.
How could I see him if he's invisible?
So what else has Superman got?
But she still might call!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
So why don't you just tell her!
Nah.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Roy --
Jeffrey!
It's on the television.
Hi.
She likes you.
Do we have to?
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
Cavalry?
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
You realize what is at stake?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
I don't know, sire.
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sire?
Was the trip normal in every respect?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
A glass of champagne, please.
Ajaccio.
When you eat him, may I have some?
When did it start?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
Does your mother know you have come?
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
No...
No... nothing at all.
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
Well, you shall see.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
And now?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Were any of them prettier than I am?
She must have been in love with you.
I don't care, but promise you will never leave me.
Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous!  If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
What was there to tell?
You mean you heard them making love?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
And, where did you see my portrait?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
Does she deserve anything better?
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Yes, sir.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
It's cool, but where's the water?
I don't know!
Great moves, Day-Day.
I ain't trying to rob you...
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
$247.
What's the matter?
Thanks a lot, Craig.
Blow.
What we gonna do?
You coming in?
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
What is it?
You wanna knock?
Hey.
I got fired too.
Where's Craig?
Shut up!  Both of you right now!
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Where did Craig move to?
You too big.
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
Amtrack?
What?
How do you know that?
What?
You get another chance in ten minutes.
One thirty. California Ballroom.
I want'to talk to her.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Who?
Oh, Jesus ...
Then why'd you drag me into it?
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
You're going to go see her.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
Fuckin' A.
You have, huh?
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
Why?
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
You understand?
Leavin', boy?
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
Where's Ruby?
About what!
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Lynch him! Lynch him!
You go set down by the River.
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
What!
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
To see Dad?
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
John, where are we g --
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
I'll see to Pearl.
Huh?
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
What are you doing, boy?
What?
Now it's your turn.
O no! Your turn!
I'm hungry.
Pearl and John.
Yes; from the first night.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
Answer me!
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
You okay?
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
No.
What happens if they don't do that?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
What!?
She dreamed this would happen...
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Nan, I --
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Where you think you're going?
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Okay... You need anything, just call.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Dead and gone.
Someone else was there.
Do you think I did it?
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
I have nothing to hide.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
What is it?
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
No, sir.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
We can wait.
Leon, my little boy.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
How much does this cost?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
That's even better.
Allow me, Comrade.
If there is anything we can do for you...
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
What business?
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
I must get into that country of yours!
You're going to force us... huh?
You, please.
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
You are something we do not have in Russia.
That is correct.
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
The telephone is ringing.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
Yes.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
No... go on.
I promise... I swear.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
What, darling?
But, darling, you can't do that.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
I know... it's the Russian soul.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
But I can throw it out of the window.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
...but big.
It is their wish.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Now, Swana...
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
Yes, Swana.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana.
Yes.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
I must insist that you leave.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Good morning, Comrade.
Where to, madame?
At Père Mathieu's.
Your Highness.
You did say it, sir.
So ... let's go ...
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
I'll bet he would.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Yeah?
McCord? ...
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
No, sir.
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
The country's loving it.
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
Who?
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
The army?
I don't know anything about that.
Sir?
That fruitcake!  What about him?
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
All right.
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
You never told him?
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
Sir?
How?
What about the documents he promised?
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Mr. Castro.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
How about Kissinger along with him?
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
You all right?
... give me a break, Mary.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
Thank you, Fidel Castro.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
No.  I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Then I'll be there for you.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Because ... I have to relax.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
Penny for your thoughts.
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
And what am I doing?
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
How many a those things you got now?
'Predate it.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
You don't know what he thinks.
Most don't.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Uh-huh.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
That's the boy.
But you don't believe it.
Wasn't no bullet?
No sir.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
Well they always is to the party concerned.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
Not like that. Not like you say.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Llewelyn.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
You can't afford one?
Yes I do.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
I know where it's going to be.
And where is that.
Where does he work?
Hello?
Is Llewelyn there?
...You getting anything on this?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
Why would I care where you're going.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Now. We close now.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
Well... I need to close now --
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Sir?
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
What about one forty-two.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I'm retired.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
Don't jack with me.
Yes sir. Two tours.
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
Did you send anyone out there?
Bad idea...
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
You're lying!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
No, I was just... How you doing?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
...I... I know what you are.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
It's all right.
Do what?
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
That's very kind of you.
No, Del.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
You never gave us a chance...
Lyla's very nice.
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Of course.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
I don't think your friend likes me.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
David, please --
George...
What?
I came for love...
Make sure it's elevated...
What's the matter here?
I begged him to let me put that on!
That's horrible!
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
She called you 'George,' George.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Does he know you think he's real?
No, almost never.
Rosa, so you've met David?
Your husband?!
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Hell of a way to die.
You told me how to do it!
We don't know which Buick, do we?
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
Joyce was screwing Del.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
No.
Well... I think I saw her soul.
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
I see.  May I?
Seems like a nice place.
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
What the hell's going on?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Huh?
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Whuhh...
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Uh-huh.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Don't I know it.
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
Who's the honcho around here?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
You, Zack?
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
What for?
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Zack, we've got to go.
When did this happen?
What's your name, boy?
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
Before that.
Yes, sir!!
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
How late?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
That was you guys, huh?
How did it go with you guys?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
You got a girl?
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
But she expects you to marry her?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
You're welcome.
God.
I have the gun.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Get the fuck away from me.
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Asshole.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Be quiet.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Yeah, whatever.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
Something's weird.
Can't hear a thing.
"What we want is in that room."
Small space?
What, what, what is it?!
Blue is phones?
What?
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Huh uh.
Not an option.
Where is the Glucogen?
Alma I told you to...
What are you doing with the gun?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
So... we understand each other Judge?
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
You want me to put a man on it?
Now hold on Rodgers...
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
That's right brother... listen and learn.
We need money first...
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
So what's the deal?
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Maybe...
Nothing.
Motherfuckers...
It was Sabu killed Cy.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
You couldn't have known.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
The middle colonies?
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
Flanking riders?
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
You don't hate him.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Thirteen years...
You were an Englishman then...
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington.
They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
It is ended.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
How many came back?
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Yes.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
What's up, sugar?
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
God, that's fine.
I don't know.
No need to apologize.
Does she love the cat?
What say, Louis?
What do you mean?
I'm not climbing that.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Is there quicksand?
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Why, then, things should be fine.
What?
It's Ellie's cat.
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
Shit! Look at this mess!
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
My God!
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
We got that part.  Anything else?
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
Then why aren't you eating?
It's a pirate medallion.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
What?  He never told me that.
We're not going to just surrender!
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
You would do that?
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You cheated.
Where does it make berth?
Because you're a pirate.
I can get you out of here.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Shut up, before you lose them all!
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
What happened here?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright's.  I believe she is hiding something of ours there.
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
... plastic.
Oh no?  Smell this.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
She says it's not.
Icky!  What's happening?
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
A man?
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
Of course, sir.
You're afraid of him.
Been out for six months now.
Is that so?
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
Susie... I...
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
You were looking for us?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
Oh, Mother!
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
What do you want?
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
I bring a message from Garcia.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Yeah.
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Yes.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
Thanks, thanks.
It's the smoke.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Staring at us?
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
What could I be?
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Traps shut!
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Sure.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
All right, Grandma—
Good morning, everybody—  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
And you struck him right here in our house—?
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Found no skeletons?
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
What?
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
Sure is pretty.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
What'll it be?
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Thank you very much.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Are you alright?  What is it?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
Why am I out of order?
Dan! Arrest them!
Hello Bud.
What color is that hedge of yours?
The other one?
What did you do?
We're supposed to be in school.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Play along?
Who's that?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
He won't notice anyway.
What do you mean?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
They don't have that kind of potential.
You're reading?
No. She really liked you.
Can I ask you a question?
That was sure swell ...
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
What do we do?
Scout?
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
BUD.
I want a word with you ...
What do you mean?
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
Why?
Yeah ...
You know what I really like?
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
Yeah ...
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
So you can't talk to me?
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
I know.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
You look nervous.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
I feel really on the spot now.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
I....please don't do this.
Tell me why.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Hi, is this Jack?
This is Georgia.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
Are you watching a porno movie?
...just talking to you....
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
...yes...
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
...yeah....well you have me now.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Yes.
Yeah.
Really? Please?
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Business is good, you're busy?
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
Yeah, no, I see --
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Yes.
I have a better idea of where we can go.
There's a better place for us to eat.
You don't think you'll go --
I don't freak out very often.
Lena?
About six months ago. Why?
I just wanted to make sure.
Do you wanna have sex?
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
What is this?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
And your Social Security number.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
How you doin' Barry?
That was weird. I meant good.
And I'm sorry that I did that.
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hi.
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
What time are you gonna be there?
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
What's the problem?
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
It's ok. That's alright.
I'll go pay for my car.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
Has he hurt you?
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
He can't do that to me.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
What the devil --
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
-- water! --
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
It's no secret that you loved her.
Who's to say I did not?
I'm here.
Well...?
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
Did I frighten you?
Most assuredly.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
I am not a wealthy woman.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
There's nothing to explain
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
I just want to understand--
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
I can't remember the lines!
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
The great Spanish bullfighter
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
It's 350 pages long.
Hey, kid. Gregg.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Shit
Yes.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
Get out
They've all seen a rough cut
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
It's just that my movie is so-
It was the best, kid
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
Oh, no--
He's Christ?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Jack! Enough!
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
Does that mean...
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
Who asked you?
But, Jake, I was just...
I was just...
What?
What did I say?
That he's got a pretty face.
All I did...
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Don't make no difference no more.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
And you're drinking with them right now.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
You think I made all this up?
By the way  what happened to your leg?
Who left -- where?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
I can't do that.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
This is Wednesday.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Something wrong?
I don't know what you mean.
No.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
She expects me to marry her.
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Isn't he a salesman?
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
Huh?
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Not yet, Jeff.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
How can you tell that -- from here?
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
Three.
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
What's the apartment house number?
To get on home.
That's what the witnesses told him.
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
Steady Marlon!
Nobody chickened.
Just him.
Jim Stark.
How'd he get in?
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
No.  We're going to bring him down.
You thought I was Mom?
What would you do, Dad?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
We don't have time.
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
You're absolutely right!
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Excuse us a minute?
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
No.  It's perpetual motion.
What?
They're looking for you!--
What?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
When was that?
No.  At dawn.
Why?
No.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
He called me chicken.
And your folks didn't understand?
What a zoo!
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Hi.  I saw you before.
See, I'm new.
Yeah--why--
Dig the square wardrobe!
Sure.  Lots of times.
I felt like it.
Well--we're newlyweds.
I don't know.
What?
Why?
So do you.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
Is he your friend?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
He hates me.
How did you know that?
We were romantic then too--
You promised me!
He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  Bury him all over the place.
He wants the money.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
We sell children's toys --
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
...maybe I die for Nick...
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
They've never done a robbery?
Nick, the ice is --
I love you, Nick...
I don't know...
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
No --
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
No, you can't --
She says a lot of things.
Bam Bam.
A station wagon in Canada.
You knew the place --
Five million?
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
No, you're not.
Ash?
Ash?
Take 'em.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
What?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
Monsters in the gelatin...
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
I'm just talking.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
GUARD!!!
Tell Ashley... I...
...for Christmas...
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
Who?
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
Who, Mr. White?
A little.
What about?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Wong?
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
Sorry, it's my book now.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
He don't believe in it.
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
What're you talkin' about?
Why?
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Lie back down, and try to -
C'mon, throw in a buck.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
Want a smoke?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
How can you be so sure?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
Of course.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
We don't think this place is safe.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Tell them to come on in.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Why do you think?
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Tell me, darling.
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
It's going to Sonora.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I can't --
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
How'd you happen to miss?
That's right, Steve.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Oh... that's the time you went away.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
You got no business snoopin' around --
What is it?
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
Clay Phillips.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Would you like to learn them?
Maybe I could start you out.
And you've got me all figured out?
But you're his brother.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Help!
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
I know, but I've been thinking --
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
I think so.
Okay, I get the point.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
How about these buns?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
I don't like this, this...
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
What the hell?!
What are you working on?
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
This part removes the sense of humor.
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Did you hear?
You don't think...
Bring her home... I guess.
You said you hated him.
Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
I certainly did.
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
No, I don't.
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
...Browsing.
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Sure I do.
You think my sister is there?
Can we go there now?
Let's get out of here.
We can't stand here all night.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
Nothing.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
No!
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
And then?
Yes.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
I've lost my knack.
Uh—huh.
Wait —- there is that other favor.
Tell me what?
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish — to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
I'm very, very serious.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
Yes.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
Because I have something very important to do.
But he also wrote --
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Yes?
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
I don't know.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Do you want them?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Who's Donna?
Yes.
Don't you want to make one?
It won't. Are you ready?
Sometimes. Afterward.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
Can't.
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Because.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Come on!!
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
I'm not either!!
Bastard...
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
What visitor?
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
That you are under no obligation to me?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
What are you talking about?
Fine.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Questions about sex.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
I get real busy between two and four.
Nope.
About what?
You just want to ask me questions?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
He said that my hand felt good.
Yes.
I can't talk you into it?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
No.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
Could be risky.
John Millaney.
Nothing wrong with trying.
What's so stupid about it?
I like the way he dresses.
Right.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
It hurts that you would say that to me.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
IBM.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Is that the man who called you up here?
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Another kiss?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
But where are you going?
What do you want to call me at the office for?
You say something?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
That's us.
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
YOUNG BLOOD
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
I'm...happy.
Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
BRAD!
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Highliner.
They're from both of us.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Stephanie.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
You said you had it all lined up.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Don't open that now. It's warm.
That's your problem, Miles.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Huh.
What do you smell?
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
With Maya?
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
What?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
Can you give me some room here?
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Obsessively.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
What's up?
Thanks.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
That's thoughtful.
What's it look like to you?
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
We gotta go back.
So what's the plan?
What's wrong?
What the fuck!
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
Maya, how are you?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
This is good. Little hints of clove.
She got anything good?
You got kids?
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Oh. You mean... today?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Yeah. Thanks.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Bathroom over there?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Good. So did I.
About two-thirty.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
You quit drinking?
See you over there, Miles.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Houdini's sick.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
It's noise.
Merrill!
Don't touch him.
Morgan?
Oh.
Stop crying!
It's not broken.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
Forget it.
Where were you?
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
My name is Emmett.
Offend anybody lately?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
He is that.
The other guy drew first.
Who is he?
You wanted to see me?
What's stopping you?
He must be pretty good.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
I took out thirteen dollars.
What is it you want from me?
Stella.
You really are a gambler.
How about you?
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
"Forever".
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
Soon.  Soon.
-- I can explain.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Hello?
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
You look so, so...
... so much like her?
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
Hello, Hal.
Why not?
I know what you mean.
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
I need flesh and --
You do?
"Straw God" changed my life.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Can't you stop that?
I read.
Okay, Dad.
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
Do I know you?
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
-- I bet you have.
I'm keeping it in trust.
Abduction?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
Taller, Viktor.
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, are you there?
Maybe he can.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Wow. They called you their son.
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
I forgot your name.
Dr. Crowe.
You said the "s" word.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
Dr. Crowe.
What makes you think that?
I told you what I want.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Yes, I am.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
Communicate?
What are you thinking, Momma?
How did you--?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Get off his case sweetie.
Slut.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
Hey. Fuck you.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Are you crazy?
"And a slash-slash there --"
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
Ow!
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Get out of here.
I almost thought for a second...
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
What you up to?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Grant, where'd you go?
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
It's my nature.
What the hell are we going to do?!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Shelby --
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Praise Jesus.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
Kate McConnell.
A what?
They're both a challenge.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Hey...
You know this guy, don't you?
Mississippi's the other way!
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
An unmarked police car.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
What are you gonna do when you get home?
One to five?
Absolutely.
Why should I?
I'm begging.
I'll do it.
No.
Go.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
I ran into complications.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Never mind. It's nothing.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
-- How we doing?
Talk to me.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
That crazy sumbitch made it.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
He's giving them up?
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
Mortal.
Did he give you his name?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
I'm here, where's the car?
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
Okay.
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
I could have it sent out...
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
They what? What? No. No. Why?
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
It's the last place they'd look.
-- okay, g'head --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
Like a mafucka.
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
I DON'T KNOW!
Bulllllshit...
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
No?  Who am I, then?
A puppet.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
No.  There's no behavior modification.
He'll let me in.
Why, who did you see?
Will she come back?
Don't.
Rheya...
You want to fuck her?
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
What does Snow think you should do?
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
Why did she do it?
No.  I love you.
Can you sleep?
Rheya.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
You said he was dead.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
Neither did I.
You never said you wanted one.
Chris --
I want you here.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I want to stop taking those pills.
I think they help.
Gibarian was under enormous --
You didn't like him?
Hi.
I'm supposed to call in.
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Put it on my account, please.
Hmm...
Didn't do very well, did you?
They're kind of fuzzy.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
Yeah.  It was.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
But "nice".
Tell it like it is.
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
So.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Tommy...!
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Mike?
What are you talking about?
I can still use a gun.
I'd identify him.
What did she say the down payment was?
I had to follow her to a store.
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Mike, take it easy...
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
I'm sorry.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
Ellie...
Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
No, sir...
I asked for the man in charge...
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
How about dinner tonight?
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Remember Little League?
I know.
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Can't focus...
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
How about tomorrow?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
How very dull, Peter Parker.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
But you like that in a man?
Some prep school thing.
Does it have a human name?
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
What's your problem?
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
You'd feel what?
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
So you've found Thorkel?
Toxic dumps, huh.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Yeah, Roz.
I'll introduce you.
It's Friday night...
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Coming up.
There's only one pair left.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
You make my mouth water.
What are you looking at him for?  Any objections, Sefton?
How much more do we have to take from him?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
You won't get off that cheap.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Aufstehen, gentlemen! Please! You do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today!
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Let me go!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Let me alone.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
Not yet.
Why the south latrine?
Los, los. Dummkopf!
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Says who?
We did it.
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
You off your rocker?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
You can tell Father Murray to --
Give this to Joey, will you?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
Are you questioning me?
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
Captain=8A
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Population?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
Data, this isn't the time.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Do you remember him?
What happened to you?
We don't have a tractor beam.
Better?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
Yes.  Thank you.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Is there a problem?
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
The royal...studs?
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Tractor beam, aye!
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Will we get another ship?
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Why don't we beam it up?
David... Sorry I'm late.
... Fascinating.
I'll handle that later.
What is it?
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Saavik... Is... David with you?
What? What are you saying?
Why would you do this...?
The word, sir?
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
What about surface life signs...?
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Would you look at that?
Gentlemen. Good evening.
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!

"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
Yes...
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
You amaze me, Commander.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Now that's what I call a meal.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
But the child --
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
Where's Dr. Marcus --
What?
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
I'm trying, David.
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Just barely, sir.
She's not responding...
... No response, sir.
The word is given: warp speed.
I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
The prefix code?
Aye sir --
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
... the good of the few...
You earned it.
That was a little joke.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Yes.
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
Admiral?
But the damage report -- we were immobilized...
Admiral on the bridge!
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
You do this -- for friendship?
Heard there was some excitement.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
That is what I said, Doctor.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
We're just -- observing.
The top of what?
My name?
I do not know your name.
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
Back to San Francisco.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Iowa.
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
Implicitly.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
Where could you take them?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
Sorry, that's classified.  I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
Permission to come aboard.
Permission granted.
Where are you going?!
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
The late 20th Century.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
Uhura!... Where!
Estimate range, ship to whales!
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
Admiral! There be whales here!
Full power, sir.
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
I am well, Admiral.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Transparent aluminum?
Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
You have warp capability?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
Really?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Very funny...
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
It is not over.
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do...
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Full impulse.
That's your expert opinion?
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
Deck five.
Captain...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Wine, women and song.
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Augh.
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
Yes...
Vulcan?
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
I am the Borg.
I told you, there's no --
Where?
How serious is the damage?
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Captain, the Enterprise!
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Jean-Luc Picard.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
There is no invasion...
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Why?
Life signs?
Captain...?
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Report.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Good luck, sir.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Report!
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
I remember it made me sick.
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Even Data?
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
Damned clever if you ask me...
We're explorers not diplomats!
Are you carrying a surgeon?
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
That isn't true...!
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
An INCIDENT?
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Stand down your weapons.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
Surely not.
Where?
What the -
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
You must have faith.
But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
If you are logical.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
And if they're still in place?
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Because you are dangerous.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
A bit less florid, Data.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
You have a red shirt.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. I’d say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
Why is it moving?
It's you.
No.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
No.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.

Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
How long until he can fire?
So, human... you've met your better self!
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Strength in numbers?
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
It's not quite the face you remember.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
Not so long.
I hope you're still alive, Jean Luc.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
So they’ve got him up and running.
Intruder alert!
The bond is broken.
I'll take that.
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
I make maps.
Where did you stop last?
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
What?
Mrs. Haydn...
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Marc Shermin.
Mrs. Haydn...
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
What?
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
From?
Shit?
You. Mouth closed.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
A drink.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
Yes.
Yes.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
I like this music.
On the radio they say it's good.
You can have one.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
You are cold.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
But...
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
Yes.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
How long will it take you to get home?
The yellow one.
Where do you think you're going?
Slow down, slow down.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Twenty-eight years.
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
Maybe.
Damn right.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
No.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
So've I.  Too much.
But this is a bad one.
Top ten.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
He's been cooked-off
Where's Faith?
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
What?
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Forget her.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
Black.  Jack.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
So the guy's not a sicko.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Mace... you're a girl.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
There seems to be a discrepancy.
I've been looking for you.
Speck. Harold Speck.
Its called insubordination.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
What I do requires confidentiality.
"Was?"
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
Don't you touch him.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
What's that?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
Jesus.
The tattoo?
You mean --
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Start killing people for real?
I...
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
Agent Mackelway?
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
He's moved on to TV.
You knew it was me all along?
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Was it Zero?
[Lionheart, what happened?]
Let's talk about Zero.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
I don't...
But why attack an Agent?
350 miles.
I don't think you understand.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
You have to put things in perspective.
I'm sorry?
Yeah.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Anything?
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Oh my God.
No...
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Why not?
It's a rebound.
Me too.
Yeah, hold on.
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
There's the rub.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
It's definitely a step back for me.
I didn't want to say anything.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
Oh.  Where is this place?
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
I got to at least try once.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
You haven't been drinking, have you?
Uuuuugh!
Then why won't she call...?
You miss the pain?
What's he do?
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
We're going to Vegas.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
Vegas.
It doesn't matter...
That's where we make our scene.
Double down.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
What an asshole.
What an asshole.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
What was the part?
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
No! Not the camera guy!
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
He drives a carriage.
What?!?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
We got the digits, baby.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
No.
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...shivering...
You're money.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
You dick.
...Sue...
It's on...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
You look terrif on the floor!
Outside.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
When did he call?
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
And this?
For killing a man.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
How do you know I come from America?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Yes.
Give them some money and send them home.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Was there a definite proposal?
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Mike, why am I out?
You like spaghetti?
Al Capone!
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
And what do you want for Christmas?
Michael?
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Huh?
I can't...
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Oh Michael.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Tell me!
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
We're going to New Jersey?
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Is he alive?
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
What? What's this?
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
You like jazz!
I love jazz.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Shoes too?
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
Frederico!
Dickie?
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
Freddie, do you have something to say?
Far cry from New York.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Tom.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
I never said that!
That ring's so great. The green one.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Where's Dickie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
That's a terrific idea.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
What's funny?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Is Freddie in Rome?
You're kidding.
So -- are you travelling under R?
We'll be there.
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
I've been backpacking.
Do you want me to stick around?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Hello. What are you up to?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
What about Thomas Ripley?
A few days ago.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
You like ball games?
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Yes?
Where do you live?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
What did you do?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
The DMZ?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
What?
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
But... Betsy...
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
This I gotta see.
Oh, are you all right?
Is he Italian?
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
I don't like my real name.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
But that one night?
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Cops don't do nothin.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Age?
Education?
Military record?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
Your name Sport?
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
Well, I just, you know...
Like do anything, you know.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Stick with Carla.
Spit it out.
Well yes I suppose ...
You suppose?
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
What are you doing?
Surprise, surprise.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Womack ripped it up, right?
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
I see you got the telegram.
You look... different.
You first.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
What did... what did I want to be?
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
No, sir.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
No wallet, huh?
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Well...
Ha!
Here, one of mine.
Call me... Ishmael?
Evening, Luke.
I... I don't believe this.
No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
That's not the country Luke fought for.
Not at all.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Sit.  Play with me.
What?
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
I was wondering...
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
I did.
Yes.
Look.
Mother!
Oh, I suppose so.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
The little Brenner girl.
Try my best.
Yes?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
It's a surprise, you see.
Of course.
Thank you.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Thank you.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
A what?
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Yes.
How long have you known her?
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
Oh, my God, look at her!
I can handle it.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
That's the last of it.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Does this room look silly?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
I understand completely, sir.
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
But how... how do you know my name?
I didn't break that window!
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
Yes.
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
Right next to the one you already had.
Oh. That. Rome.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
Yes.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Are you all right?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Of birds?
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
Melanie, Melanie...
The bay doesn't.
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Where are they heading?
The power.
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
You have his promise, then?
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Aye.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
I've heard of it.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
Yes, I suppose so.
Gray killed her.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
No.
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
He was a nice horse.
A doctor?
I am the best man for the job.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
I'll not do it, Gray.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
Only Brother.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You lied at my trial.
What did they give you?
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
The scar.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
Yeah, we do.
What's with your friend there?
You want me to walk a straight line?
Why are there so many?
I think I dropped an earring.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
Please. Come inside.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
I leave that in your hands.
No -- not at all.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
That can easily be arranged.
Hi Mom!
Professor Barnhardt.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
What do you mean, dear?
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
I don't believe it.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Thank you... Have you any news?
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
I will be in just a minute.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
I don't know how to thank you.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
Where are you going now?
But how -- how long--?
No. That's all finished.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
They would have killed this man?
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
They're gaining on us!
All together?
Whattaya mean?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
Ouch, my hair...
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
Still mad at me?
He's just a deep sleeper.
See you later.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Sure.
Ocean air!
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
But, Mom...
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
I'm really sorry, Max.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
I guess you're new around here.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.
Then it's not too late for us...
It's gone.  I feel it!
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
I'm making you a sandwich.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
That night?
Yeah.
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
What?
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
MacReady!
What do we do about those three?
MacReady!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
You ain't tying me up.
We should have jumped his ass.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
In this weather?
How long will it take you to prepare this?
A couple of hours.
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
How many in their party?
You reach anybody yet?
Put that down!
We're on fire!
How long's it been?
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
What do you do on the towers?
And everyone looks like us?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
But you're only a mud carrier.
Yes.  Just about here.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
How did you know?!
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Sir... have you a name?
Morlocks --
In for a penny, in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
Vox...
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
You took her because she helped me.
It's spectacular...
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Got here as soon as I could.
You know I can't.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
All right, what is it now?
I mean... well... affection.
You know I can't.
I need... to talk to you.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
Oh?
For God's Sake, David --
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
This... was my home.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Yes.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
Why?
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Good night, then.
Yes!
What's it all for?
You lost someone.
Mara -- what -- ?!
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
I see.
Imagine that.
No, sir --
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
We choose to believe it.
What did you do at night?
What about Starks?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
And what does that mean?
[Beat] You're his son?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
Do I know you from somewhere?
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
I might not be able to.
Where are we going?
Good. How's your mom?
How you doin'?
How?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
Why don't you help me?
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
You like it?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Hon.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're real busy right now, but how many times, Max?  How many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? You could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
Peaches.
Hello...
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Am I in trouble?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
So what are you gonna tell him?
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
You think you've found your calling?
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Try to.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Before.
Like a Chihuahua?
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
This is so beautiful.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Eeuww.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
We can live in a hacienda.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
What in the hell is that up there?
Now what?
Say you're sorry.
Hi!
We're fine!  How are you?
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Good-looking?
Well... at least now you know.
What?
I am?
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Huh.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
Thanks.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
I already know it, Mary.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
A fucking moron.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
All set.
Urrggghh...
Are you okay?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
No.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Do what?
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
You were following us?
Oh... Sully.
What's he like?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Holy shit...
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Huh?
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
Hm?
Now by killer, you mean...?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Get out.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
I, uh... I got it stuck.
You got what stuck?
Is it the frank or the beans?
I wasn't trying --
So what's up?
How are you doing, Warren?
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
Yeah.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
It ain't Geronimo.
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Six rounds. 357.
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
She's that subtle?
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Why?
Ray...
What?!
His spiritual mother...
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Still after Jimmy?
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
I could be, too.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
Apology acknowledged.
I'm special.
What are you talking about?
Harmless!
What about the plane?
Make what?
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
You want to go ballistic?
And now?
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
That's what you get flight pay for.
Where are we?
I want it back.
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Tomcats?
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
MAVERICK.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Were upside down!
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Gotta go, man.
You go. I'm staying with it.
Is there something I should know?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
You ever done this before?
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
I was a victim of circumstance.
What'd you do?
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
That's because you don't have any women.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
ON THE NOSE?
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
I think I can work it out on my own.
Just below ten thousand.
So have I.
You didn't help.
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
Or you can quit.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
He was by the book, all the way.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
Hetero.
What do you want?
Not since you lost him.
HER!
Pull them out.
Sit down.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
Where is he?
Let's do it.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
Lori, move.
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
You went to those brain butchers?!
The hell you're not.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
How real does it seem?
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Don't be ridiculous.
He's lying.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
Wait!
Or a big mother slug maybe?
You guys all set?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
You know, up the jeep trail.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Why?
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
You're full of shit.
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
What?
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
Come on.  Get away from it!
Twenty.
You okay?
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Ms. Vin's sister.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
How can you remember that?
You're implying that I planted a gun?
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
-- What?
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
-- What?
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
I killed the motherfucker.
No. You tell me, Shu.
Oh come on, Cecil.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
Edward T. Dowd.
That's right.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
No.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
Shouldn't one of us...?
What do you want?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
CIA?
Albert.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
No.
What was?
We can do it right here.
Bobby's got it.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
That would indicate that it's the future.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
Where's Hap?
Any friends?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
I don't know what to do.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Where are the Cookies?
No, you should forget about last night.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
How did the car get back here?
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
We're on our way, Baby.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
What do you mean?
What?
Hiking?
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
Laura.
I hate asparagus.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Leland, what are you doing?
Leland...
Who am I?
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Come back as soon as you can.
Yes.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Nothing.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
Four cases in three years...
No -- we don't want this case in court.
How did you settle on the amount?
We thought it was just.
You know what that would mean?
This is going to drive the ante up.
I wouldn't do it.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
I know of him.
...of Anesthesiology?
Ed Concannon.
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Anything special about the case?
'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Tell me one?
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
I didn't do too well for you.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Right. Who called?
...and you're going to do that?
Yes.
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs. Simmonds.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Still looking.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
I'm a lawyer.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
What...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Well, then what are you doing here?
Not if you don't grow up...
No.
Mr. Alito, please.
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I've got nothing to say to you.
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
...I understand...
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
...I'm going to need your help...
Mick. Mick. Mick...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Today is Tuesday. What?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
The troops are certainly moving in here!
Can you handle one of these?
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
Is that... machine...?
Where are we?
How long was I out?
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
The nightmares.
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
What?
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
He's had some sort of...episode.
He was just acting very strange.  He thinks somebody's after him, Chase. It's scary, it scared me.  He was acting like...
These look quite fresh.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
DO you mind...
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
Dylan, I gotta go.  Forgive me?
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Dylan, where's the man?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Seemed, not was.
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
Studio B.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Yes?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
Now?
Did we lose anybody?
Come in.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Well, that's all part of it.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Where's Mom?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
Believe what?
Ninety-six.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Figured what out?
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
Hey, shut up will ya?
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Yes.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
Ya know... "It".
Jesus, you never told them?
Shouldn't we turn away?
What's on your mind?
Well, spit it out.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
And being sixteen.
That's enough.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
What makes you so sure it was one?
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
They are much more than that, sir.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
And you didn't do anything about it?
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Artie? That you, Artie?
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
How 'bout a beer?
Have now.
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
No... She's fine. Back home.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
In what capacity?
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
You ain't actin', mama.
Hey baby...
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
You okay, honey?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Sailor!
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
What kinda trash talk is that?
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
What was this one?
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Uh huh.
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
Yeah?
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
And Bobby too, I hear...
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Yes.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
You need to explain it.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
I just mean...
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
Which is?
Is he awake?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Shut up, James.
The hood jumper?
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
Excuse me?
I passed out.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
'Fraid so.
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
The guy on the phone.
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
Jealous? Of me?
You're lying.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Professor Tripp...?
Me? Sure. Why?
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Jesus.
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
But where? I need the street.
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too.  Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
I'm sure.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
I heard.
James Leer.
Sara.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Are you sure you parked it there?
And what do you think you might have said?
That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it?
James is... I don't know...
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Oh?
Who's that guy?
Do you get high, Sam?
What made you pull out that old thing?
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
I might have his number on campus.
George Sanders?
No shit.
Beautiful. How's business?
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
How is she?
How old is Anna?
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
That was terrific.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
Hiya, Walter.
Yeah.
They grow outside, don't they?
Do you believe in them?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
I could take you downtown.
Yes.
So. How are you adjusting?
Are you sure?
What's her name?
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
I can't.
Yes?
And how's your job?
I said the job is okay.
No way.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
We have a lot of work to do.
What is your idea of being normal?
I want to be normal!
Not so fast.
Where?
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
What?
You never spoke to me before.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
They could eat you.
I get that impression.
No you're not.
The morning?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
Molested little girls?
Look, you can go now.
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
I've changed.
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
You never asked them about it?
You're scared.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
What's your fucking problem?
You okay?
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Where are we?
I'm taking you back out.
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
No.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
You owe me one, Virgil.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
I don't know how!
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
We'll go in through that large breach.
What's the matter with you?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
4800 feet.  It's official.
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
Claudia, aren't you coming?
And how long will you be away?
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
You already know what they are.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
Have you decided?
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Claudia, let's get married?
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Good night, my love.
To do what?
But for what reason should I come there?
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
And who is this?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
You men are all so dreadful!
And where do you find the models?
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Your mother?
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
I would like to ask you something.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
I can't say.
One of the other Sisters?
Because I'm getting fat.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Look at the statues, they're thin.
I burnt them.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
Yes, Mother.
Yes.
Do you think he loves you?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Why should they?
Something I ate.
Down... there.
Yes.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Martha Louise Livingston.
No.
Where do you think babies come from?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
What things?
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
What the child?
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
What did you do?
No...
Yes?
Alright.
Are you pretty?
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
Yes.
Did you want it to come out?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Will she be angry?
Someone's following me.
Which one?
Of what?
Why isn't anyone coming?
Frightened.
Yes.
For what he made me go through.
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Yes.
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Obviously there was.
And you didn't try to find out who?
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
That possibility never occurred to you?
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
Not simple, no.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I'm only interested...
Then help her.
I am...
How?
Earthquakes?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
I knew that after the fact.
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Don't deny it!
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Right...
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
For the Church?
She's been touched by God, yes.
Why must he be anybody?
Don't be ridiculous.
She is an innocent.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
I'm concerned about her health.
Where is she?
For what?  An abortion?
You tied the cord around its neck.
They're yours.
Well --
Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
Just you?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
I'll murder that Lennon.
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
I don't snore.
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
Is he?
Well, what happened?
Are you supposed to be here?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Is it ... is it, really?
Thank you.
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
Ah.
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Oh, they seem all right to me.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Eh?
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Like what?
Let's go and muck in.
What's he know?
No.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
I'm not, no.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
What have you heard?
It'll only get you into trouble.
Well!
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
None for me, then?
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
Cattle ranch!
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Just machinery.
Are you okay in there?
Breathe deeply.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Why, what's wrong?
What do you mean?
Dead!
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
It's clear.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
Right. 
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
It's over, Hunter.
Still unconscious?
Yes.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
... And Broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle.
We can use the flamethrower.
This should do it.
How far?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
No, it's coming.
How?
That's the one about the albatross, right?
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Okay.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Found what?
This ship is full of cat hair.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
Yes!
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Can we get to him?
It was time for that a couple days ago.
That'll blow the ship up.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
No... don't...
Thanks.
What's happening?
Shit.  When?
What's going on?
Whoa, wait a minute...
What happened?
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
What's the problem?
And...?
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
You should hit the sack, too.
Give me a yell is something happens.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
Just some coffee.
Just like that, eh?
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
Addison...
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
You have no right to say such things!
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Champion to champion.
What have you got to do with it?
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Because I don't want to.
We never met. That's why.
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
She did...?
Yeah... I will.
How is Eve? Okay?
Cut it out.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
Why you have to go out there.
I just asked a simple question.
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
So am I.
What have I got to do with it?
You think?
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Late for what?
Oh, no...
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
I'm not crying.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
I think I know...
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
Congratulations, Eve.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
How'd hear about it?
Well... it started with the play before this one...
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
They're your fans, your audience-
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
What about Bill?
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
How was the concert?
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
Coming?
It's just possible she didn't...
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
That was a pity...
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
With gestures, of course.
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
Who is it? What's it all about?
Who's left out there?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
How's the new one coming?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
Hello..
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
Answer my question!
I didn't hear you.
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
--mine's better--
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
July of '71.
--I'm trying--
Why didn't we get that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Facts or theory?
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
He's another Ivy Leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understanding--might surprise him if you're not.
You want me to be the bastard.
Think Sloan's back?  What's wrong?
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--I haven't said anything--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
I think.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Something maybe big.
It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
But they both worked at the White House?
--I'm not your source on that--
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
Same kind of crap--
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Go on.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Where?
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
That was awhile ago.
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
The what to what?
...okay...
You can call me Oz.
You can call me Ostreicher.
Forget it.
Neither will I.
Why are you doing this?
That's nice.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
I don't get it, that really works?
Don't you love my sexy body?!
You're so big!
Ow, what the hell?
Hey, minuteman.
What the heck is this?
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Let me know.
I think "shithead" really says it.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah, are you?
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
Either way works for us...
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Are you okay?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
They're coming!
We don't both have to die.
Ha. Some wonder drug...
What?
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Where is it! Please!
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
What did she say?
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Well?
Okay. So maybe you were right.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
We're just going to refresh your memory...
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
Come on up!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Every Russian family has one..
It's the best fork of all
Trust me, it's her!
How do you know?
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
Bartok... a question.
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
I did no such thing!
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Hey!
You're like New York. You're an island.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
What-what-what-what's the matter?
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Oh - you're an actress.
Uh, you're driving a-
For yuh.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
Fifteen years, yeah.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
what I mean?
think that's, uh-
It's terrific.
M'hm.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
M'hm.
Were you always funny?
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
Who cares? Who cares?
I'm home!
Yeah?
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
M'hm.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Will it change your wife?
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
I'm following you and David, if you-
Oh. What?
Yeah?
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
Okay, let me have this.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Check it out.
Remember, we had that thing.
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Oh, good. Okay.
Remember that day?
Thanks, honey.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
You look very pretty.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
I can't.
What-
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Ah.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
I have some very good memories there.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Well, sit down.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
And... uh-
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
His wife has diabetes!
She was stealing.
But she's colored.
All right-so we can afford it.
Hey-
I was a great beauty.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
A long time.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Absolutely not.
Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay?
Leo?
October-ish.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
What?
Oh.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
So where is young Jonah?
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
He's gonna miss his flight.
And you're not the wife.
Fuck you.
That for us?
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
Harry called.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
He's directing now.
What?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
You want me to uninvite her?
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Well he can't have gone far.
Fuck you.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
It's a novel.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Yes.
Ours.
Sally did all this herself?
Oh.
A little out of my element.
Hm.
And Ryan works at home.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
I think he's really angry with me too.
Yes.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
What?
I don't need a drug.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
Come on in.
Oh?
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
Um.  Happy for you.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Like Joe.
Hm.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
No...as a matter of fact...
I order you to find out where we are!
Worker!  Come back here now!
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Yes?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
You held onto this all that time?
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
So...you two are in love?
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Wear this.
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
Ma'am?
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
What did you do to your hair?
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Really?
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
I hope everything goes all right.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
Oh.
You shouldn't.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Your phone.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Here. How about some breakfast?
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
As soon as I can walk.
Your stomach?
I am. Let me get the cards.
A cemetery?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
You are?
Who'd care?
What are you doing with that?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
Thank you.
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
What?
Oh.
Oh.
I'm fine all over.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Oh, yes. Thanks.
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Mine?
Very clever.
No key!
You?
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
What do you want?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Sure, Doc.
Well, I have things to do --
Where are you moving to?
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
Family?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
No kidding.
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
I see.  What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Please -- just let me sleep.
You know I liked it better long.
What do you think?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
All set for what?
Baxter?
He wouldn't.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Where do you live?
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
It's a thought.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
What !
Rangers, eh?
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Let's talk about you.
A long time.
Yes, sir --
No shit.
Charlie?
What are we doing here?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
What'd he say?
We could go in tomorrow at dawn -- there's always off-shore wind in the morning.
Who knows what's up there?
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Signs?
What is it?
Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river.
What cat  ?
Spooky.
This gentleman or myself ?
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
Yeah.
About what ?
Do you know that jungle?
Where've you been riding, Lance?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
They far enough?
You smell that.  You smell that?
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
My orders are from Com-Sec Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --
What's the furthest you been in?
What'd you do for supplies?
Don't you agree?
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Who?
You've gone crazy.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
You hear it again?
You think he'd of shot us?
What's this tiger shit?
You think?
This boat's a mess.
So Kurtz is alive.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Right now -- I am.
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
48   CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
212  CONTINUED:
26   CONTINUED:
You should know something.
I'll go into town with you.
Did you catch Corbett?
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
A daughter in Oregon.
Sounds like professional jealousy.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
Yeah?
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
It was blown up with the plane.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
What does this matter to you?
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
I'm too old for this shit.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
...Ben never sent a signal.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
Go ahead.
What is it you want? What?
How was it talking to him?
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
I see the help -- judgement call.
No.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
What's this?
No... no thank you notes.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
I want you to go on this trip.
You take off when you have to.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
Never.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
It's one idea...
I'll never forget you said it.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
I don't want to hear that music right now.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I'll take you... why not?
Hello.
Were you asleep?
I wasn't asleep!!
Because...
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Well...
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Good night.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Sorry. What are those cards?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
It smells like shit in here?
Thanks.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Why are you doing this?
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
No fucking way.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
Yeah.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Who is that other guy?
Because he is trying to retire me.
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Because I'm done.
Jesus -- why?
Why did you leave the Agency?
They tried to kill you?
Are they usually like that?
No.  Just the first one.
Why not?
No.
No.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Really?
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
How was the beach?
Where did you learn it?
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
Then, we wait.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
Yes.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
What did he want?
Ten years later, here you are again.
No.
No.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
What?
That's a ridiculous move.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Was she the only one?
Four minutes.
Was nice.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
Hi.  Did you call --
Do you think about their wives or their families?
It's possible.
Average.
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
How would you like the funds?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Oh yeah, what's that?
An alternative literary venue!
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Care to elaborate?
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
Well, don't get carried away.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Perfect!
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
So why didn't we?
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Chris, can you do me a favour?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
You capitalist pig!
Huh?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
So?
Did you see anything in the files?
I made a deal with Josh.
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
So am I.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
No way Doug, I can't.
There's nothing there for me.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
Will this thing take long?
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
What's the Bugler?
We_re not all running away
Where did you steal the car?
Why did you break into that particular building?
What is it you want?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
It's more than what you're worth.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
So go dance.
You saw him?
Were you with Jamie?
Yeah.
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
I'm very sorry --
Get yourself a glass.
I don't make small talk --
'Is it really me?'
That's deep --
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
I'll take a chance.
It's private.
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
I know. Don't say anything.
Saturn. Beautiful.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
I don't want to be just your friend --
Is there a rush?
You're sometimes not sure?
What'd you tell your father?
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
I should have told you sooner --
Anything you want.
Lower. Same page.
Will you do something for me?
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
But if you could, you would?
By accident --
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
Up to?
It was a play.
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
Please.
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself.  Some of us remember how your father --
This is 1952....?
Uh, yes, sir...
Here's your jacket!
It's polyester.
Huh?
How are you?
What do I say?
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
Why what?
Maybe if I used my left....
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
AM or PM?
Then where the hell is he?
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
Marty, that would alter history.
A mall?
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
An atomic bomb.
I know.
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
My guess is that she turned him down.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
It was sure nice of Uncle Sam to put those yardage markers up for us. 
Thanks for everything, Pro.
What year is this?
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
No way!
What's going on?
Okay.
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
You lost that one?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Oh yeah?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
What'd you come out here for?
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you.  I'll try anything once.  What's your name? I said mine.
What for?
Can I be honest?
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
Great.
You want to go for a ride?
Why not?
You know what I think?
What?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
What'd you put him in there for?
Yeah.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Yes?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Maybe.
Okay, friend. Start running.
Hi.
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
What is this thing?  A fighter?
Where're you goin'?
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Believe in Penny Priddy?
No, sir.  I think the flint...
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
It's still a little early for me.
And what would that be, son?
I'm sorry, I just feel like –I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
...This must be boring you.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Yeah.
Yeah, but Charlie –
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Transient or resident?
L.A.P.D.
Charlie... Charlie's back...
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
There's no smoking in this building.
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
How is your -- personal life?
It's been three months.
Yes.
Catherine Tramell.
I need a cigarette.
What did she tell me, Beth?
Did I miss something?
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
There's a name from the past.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why take the risk?
Did you think it was so special?
You shouldn't play this game.
It's OK.  It's OK.
Do you believe me?
I don't know.
I found Lisa Henderson.
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
No.
Somebody has to die.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
What kind of drugs?
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
She misses me.
You feeling better?
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
So what do we do -- nothing?
She killed him.
On what basis?
Did you check all four years?
Hey – it's the big A.M..
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
What about the shit they write?
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Saddle River, New York!
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Who is it?
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
When?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Should there be?
Would you like to see the wine list?
Blue? Where?
SAMO.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry – fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
Check you later, man.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
I guess it was a long time ago.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
I guess you did.
Do you know what he's saying?
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
I hadn't thought about it.
Hi.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
What's your name, man?
Wanna Mac?
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
You see? You have someone to live for.
I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
A what?
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
What're you really after?
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
You almost sound enthusiastic.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
"We"?  You and...
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Son!
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
Alfred, are you...?
Please be looking for me.
Hey, what's your problem?
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
She knows who we are.
Winded, old timer?
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
I need the Wayne Diamonds.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
Like hell you do.
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Freezy, I'm feeling...hot.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
I've got to stop him.
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
She has an excellent mind.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
Is he all right?
The _Rolls_?
Maybe they're right.
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Perhaps the fall...
What?
How about, MR. E.
Mystery.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Why's that?
We all wear masks.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
I'm gonna need that hand back, Ed.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
So glad you could come.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
Would you? I'm not so sure.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
But...
The style of the letters I'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. Why would The Riddler be sending me riddles?  Who's your decorator? U-Haul?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
I don't-.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Bruce, you can't.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
I'll show you it works.
I got family. ...Please.
A man with a death wish.
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
Go ahead. You can say it.
Yes?
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
No one would miss me.
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
MOVE! Can't you do something??
I missed you, Lieutenant.
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
That's it?
Joker here. Can we talk?
... Thank you.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
How'd you know it was me?
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Not what?
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
Yeah. Deja vu.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Jesus.
Let's get a coffee.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Of course.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
... in the distant future.
Doctor Jacobson?
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
My butt's bothering me!
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Uh... Is this the right bus?
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Butt-dumpling...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
They perk me right up.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Does that say Xanax?
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Cavity search...?
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Where are his pants?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
You scored with two chicks?!
Who sent ya?
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
Nobody else can.
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
So can I?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
No.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
That's it!
God, you're anatomically correct!
You've got to help them.
He's your cousin.
It's <u>Otho</u>!
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
Answer your mother.
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
Any particular kind?
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
What's wrong?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Maybe Charles does.
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Yes, I have seen that show on television.
Yes. He's a very careful driver.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
No, thank you.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
To watch...? To watch me...?
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
I feel very good in here.
I agree.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
I understand.
I can't read.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
... Then you really are a gardener?
Yes. Of men and women.
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
... Yes. You can take me.
Good morning, Louise.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
No. I don't object.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
No.
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
The rank-and-file in the FBI feel he is FBI, but others feel he is a CIA man who knows how to destroy FBI files.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Thank you.
Tell your friends.
Seven-ish
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Yeah. You want a beer?
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Why aren't you at work?
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
You've always loved the animals.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
I need a shower.
My God!
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Dr. Lester...
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
I'm right?
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
My tits?
That's the usual?
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
You're late.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
You're evil, Maxine.
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
You can be John Malkovich.
Two hundred dollars, please.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
But of course.
Oh, be still my heart.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
She's not available.
Do you mind?
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Captain Mertin?
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
Not like He punished me.
No. Sorry.
You remember Halle.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
YOU HURT ME.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
That girl...You know, Beloved...
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Well, good luck with the job.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Could be that fall you took.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...
You was friends.
You?
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
Just me.
It ain't what you think.
No, You looking good.
Yes sir.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
The Gundersons.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
Can we just rent it from you?
What--
What's a pederast, Walter?
Burkhalter.
Are you gonna split hairs?
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
I'm not really, uh.
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
Nancy's pretty good.
In the briefcase?
Ahh, not so good, man.
People forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone--
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Yeah man.
Yeah, but my-
Yeah, but what about--
Delayed after-eff--
Jeffrey--
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
So...that doctor.
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Huh?
Huh.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
It's your roll--
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
Oh shit.  Walter.
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
...Huh?
What the fuck?
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Oh, shit.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Yeah.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
I said out.  Now.
Smokey Huh?
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
Anyone else make it?
Why?
What do you think?
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
I don't like it.
So?
So you're going to do this?
Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
What the fuck you doing?
His name is Jared Nomak.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
She's been bitten.
Don't try to talk --
Is something wrong, my friend?
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
You used me as bait?!
Graffiti --
Just get out of here.
Are you all right?
Is it bad?
It won't work on you.
Get out of here --
I know. Take some of my blood.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
You're a monster.
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
He killed them?
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Inside the grave?
Druid Hill Park.
That's a joke?
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Anna--
--or someone--
What'd you dream?
--hours before--
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
Does it hurt?
I don't believe this.
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Boy Kurth.
What the fuck--??
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
What--
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Why?
What?
What?
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
What?
Domini's the only logical explanation.
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
When you don't they're usually nice.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
...Who?
...You leaving?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
We don't seem to be communicating--
What's the matter?
How long did you watch her?
For the money.
...There's a big--
Red Label.
Where was I?
What?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Bull.
He's comin' back?. What for?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
I . I don't know.
No.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
Frank? .can you stand up?
Nice guy.  Who's he?
Frank would open you.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Dorothy. no!
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Heineken.
Here's to Ben.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
How is Central these days?
Terrible. boring.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yeah. but.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Oh yeah?
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
No.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
uh uh.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
No. No thank you.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
You wanna split?
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Yes, I am.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Why are you speaking?
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
I don't know...
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
I don't think so.
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
Oh hey, one more thing?
I don't want to talk about it.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
Now do you see what I am saying?
What's the matter, George?
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
You fucked me, Diego.
Cocaine?  How much?
Today.
Surprised to see me?
Mexico.
Yeah.  Nice.
And Diego?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
You mad at me?
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
No.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
What do you guys want?
George.
Figured it out.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
Yeah.
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
I didn't mean to...
Who's the co-pilot?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
Right on.
Yeah?
Holy shit, Dulli!
Are we good?
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
Third group. What's your assignment?
With an unloaded pistol?
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
Of course. As soon as possible.
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
Where were we?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
Why?
Yeah.
A massive cardiac arrest.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Who found him?
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
October twenty-seventh.
Where did you meet him?
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Hi, Joe.
Yes.
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Hi, Frank.
You and me -- making love.
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
What's that for?
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Michael -- get off the phone.
-- But it's Sunday.
No, Your Honor.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
We have to talk.
What's wrong?
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
We were here two Christmases ago.
SO!
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Bar across the street.
Carolyn!
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
She's changed.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
No.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Feeling better?
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
We got engaged.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
Do you miss it?
What?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
No. I'll do them later.
What?
Why doesn't it scare you?
No.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
I told you, I love other people.
No. But I love them just the same.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
Okay. See you later.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Are you hungry?
No. I couldn't.
You're somewhere else, where?
Am I too heavy for you?
I... What do you want?
Well, what is this?
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
STOP IT!
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Hmm?
They're not going to find her!
Unh-unh, little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
What else?  Money.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
But.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
Have you ever been inside?
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
That place is already bad luck.
Cinn?
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
What building?
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
No way man...
But --
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
That's all we did, steal their ride.
It was just like in my head.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
Not really to live, just to play.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Admit what?
All right!  Where's the key?
We know how this was done, eh?
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
There's no time.
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
Got to think this through ...
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
He didn't see you, did he?
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
We're going to need some time.
Don't tell him --
I saved you.
You betrayed me!
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
What?  How about a drink?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
What?  They ain't there?
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
Yeah.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Yeah.
'63 Chevy.
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
He's a launderer?
The redistribution of wealth?
Shit, here we go.
I don't understand - ?
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
I don't.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
Do you think you know me like that?
Any bodyguards?
Jesus, that's beautiful.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
What if he doesn't run?
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
Yes.
I want a second opinion.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
-- he went inside! --
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
I won't ask again.
What do you mean?
We have to go home, Jason.
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Sir, you waited on line.
Paris?
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Yes.  Is he there?
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
I need a ride out of here.
Oh, Jesus... 
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
You ever think maybe you have a family?
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- let me do this, okay? --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
xxxxxx...
-- what're you talking about? --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
...ergency procedures.
...ixed itself.
Machines don't fix themselves.
It's reply paid.
You don't have to sing it.
Sorry ...
Too late? That's for me to say.
You are late.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
So how ...?
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
They weren't at school with us.
Take her off the list.
Say it was a mistake.
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Oh.
Who are you? Let go!
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
You know, smoking's bad for you.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Turn around!
I thought you arrested me.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
But if they did promote you
The refund for Tuttle!
What?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
Hello ... hello ...
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
The pace?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
What do they want you or?
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
Pregnant.
You know each other a long time?
In that time, you ever have sex?
She asked me to pick her up.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
He's going to be all right, right?
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
I know him. That's Noel.
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
No.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
This is not a good time.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
I think the worst is over.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
She's no whore, Marcus.
Three legs.
Where you going?
You can't believe how much he's improved.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
Where you going?
Whatja doing?
You okay?
Let's get in a fight, then.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
That's ridiculous.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's  been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink?
What?
Don't push it, Larry.
Faster! God!
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
They booted me out of Washington.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.
I don't think so.
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
Hi.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Yes.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Which would you prefer?
Nine seconds.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Aaron, will you tell me?
I'm not kidding.
Ernie told this story.  How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried.  He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits.  He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.  I should have quit this place  three years ago.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Really?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Outside?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
But thanks.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
And Bobbie says...
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
No...no.
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
That's okay.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
I don't know.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
It's not opinion.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
Hi.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I've got another story.
What do you mean clean?
You okay?
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
What?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
Oh, good.
So you like me, huh?
So what did you think?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Hello?
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
I don't wan to discuss work.
Uh-huh.
I didn't finish talking to you!
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
What did he do?
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
What's up, Walter?
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Is it murdered man?
No! I want to talk about it now!
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Put it in the middle of the room!
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Don't ask.
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Now what kind of statue was that?
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Walter, what are you doing?
Dead Cat!
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
H-have a seat?
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
How ya doin'?
Telling you what?
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
I- don't know what you're talking about!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
Hi.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
I thought you didn't respect money!
I don't think so Mayolia.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
I was just straightening up the place.
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
I had him in my grasp.
I look horrible.
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Man has a complex.
Don't grab me, okay?
It's coffee.
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Let me in.
Get away from here.
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Buffy, honey?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
I am a God!  A God!
You sure?
I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Leave me alone.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
) What do you think?
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
I had to test you.
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
I...
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
That is so cool.
I don't get it.
I'm just a girl.
Hi, Grueller.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Oh, yeah!
Smell of booze much.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
I am.
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
A little better.
Fundamentals?
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
I did.
We lost.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
I think I'm ready for the Show.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
Damn.
You're pulling your hips out.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
Aren't we all?
What's so great about baseball?
He's a good student.
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Don't bump me.
It was a cocksucking call!
He did know.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
You been in the Majors?
Naw...
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
Boring.
C ' mon!
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
We'll pray anyway.
Well tell 'em, honey.
He walked eighteen?!
Struck out eighteen...
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Hi, Ace.
You were never my guest?!
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Was I at that dinner?
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
702 472 1862.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
Ohh!
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Hello.
No, I don't wanna come -
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
Yeah.
Please...
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I -
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
You never - ?
Hello.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Ace, listen to me.
We need this guy.
This woman's an institution.
Who's this?
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
Yeah.
You're with me now.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
Oh, fabulous.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
What? What?!
I don't need one.
No, you don't.
Right.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
Yeah.
Okay?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Yeah.
No kidding. NO KIDDING!
I threw it away.
You threw it away?
To the Riviera.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Who were you with?
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Not gonna let me in?
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
...and hypocrisy.
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
All right, I will, I will.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Thanks, Nick.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
You gotta go back out there.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
You can't talk to me like...
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Sam?
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
Calm down! Calm down!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
I know.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
You got a round figure on it?
Mm.
Sure.
I can see that. Sure.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Okay.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
What? What?
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
You did. You're right.
Yeah.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Come on.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
...all the luck in the world.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Right.
Are they out now?
Yes, don't worry.
Excuse me, but I folded these things beautifully and I would appreciate a little respect. Jesus Christ!
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Get up.
Stacy. 
This is Nick.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
Mm.
You must have drunk too much.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
I know. I know.
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Charlie M?
Charlie M.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
Oh, sorry -
What's the matter with you?
Since when do you talk like that?
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
You're probably right.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Selina, are you okay?
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Winning.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
You like them, don't you, Boss.
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I'm a good mother!
Stop.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
I actually got some memory back last night.
Enough.
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
This is one way.
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
Who's on the phone?
I didn't hurt you.
You gotta just look the other way.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
You won't disconnect.
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Who?
Stop throwing names at me.
What do they need her for?
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
26th off Wilshire.
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What are you doing now?
What do you do for a living?
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
A price on everything.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
Why tell me this?
No.
Lucky for them they didn't.
Why can't it be her?
Why didn't you just shoot them?
So far they're keeping their part of it.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
What's that supposed to me?
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
You wouldn't --
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Did you hear that?
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
What's happening?
Any idea where you're going?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
That's not good enough.
I'm handling it.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Who are you working for?
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
Who am I talking to?
The fuck I will!
How far off are you?
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
In your dreams.
Seems not.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Government business?
So who's he?
What do you think his name is?
He's still looking, Col.
Stop it, Dil --
See, they get the wrong idea.
Sure, Dave --
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Do you mean that?
What's that supposed to mean?
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
Scottish?
Everybody wants something.
Not me.
Hi.
Perform?
What look?
You want to know how I kissed him?
What do you think?
I think you do.
What does that mean?
Depends what it is.
What you thinking of, hon?
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
No...
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
Ask to meet me again.
Am I becoming repetitious?
A little.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
He'd bring me carnations.
So I got it wrong, then.
Dil, this is Jude.
Afraid so.
Come on...
Are you all right, Dil?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
You tried.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
More endearments.
Yeah.
Never.
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Lucky you.
You know her, Jimmy?
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
No, what is the thing?
What do you mean?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Leave her out of this.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
Why do you want to do that for?
I'm sure.
Who'd you think it was?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Just a girl.
Am I?
No. It's the truth.
Could you?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
Not in your nature.
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
She your wife?
So what were you fucking around for, then?
I got sent.
And you play cricket?.
Don't be so sure.
Who's Dil?
Don't think that way.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
You won't run.
Hurling --
And you know what?
I never know nothing.
It was fun while it lasted.
Have you no feelings, woman?
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
Oh!
What's the matter?
When you come on, you really come on.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
I love you, Adam.
Yes, you told me.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Agent.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Yes -- ?
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
What's your first name today?
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
Sorry about that.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Back where?
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
I met a man with sharp nails.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
Tuesday.
I'd love some, thanks.
I'm scared.
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
What? Assassinate somebody?
Reggie -- open the door.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
What do you mean, no?
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Of course it is.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
I don't know where to go.
You mean you and me?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
That's all.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Words can hurt very much.
Don't put yourself out.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Please stop -- please!
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
Because I don't love him.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
Who is it from?
What's he up to?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
I don't see him.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Hi honey.
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
A little.
I thought you'd be pleased.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
She's still a virgin.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
Of what?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
Can you get inside?
I can.
Why?
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
What do you know about my father?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Who?
Mark Shale.
Why?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
What?
I did.
Why?
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
My dad's down there!
Lisa Sherman?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
What?
What?
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
If sheep don't count.
Okay, okay.

 Oh...

Great. 
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.

He could've called first.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...and a shitload of ice.
...-er.
All right.
You want cash?
Are you kiddin'?
Damn.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
We're clear.
No cell.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
...-er.
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck! That's...
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
...fine.

...I'm not the psycho.
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
 Oh...
...you crazy bastard.
 Gee, you think so?
 Oh...
 Go on.

All right.
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 

Then stay...
I don't want you to come anyway. 

...did you?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
...miles.
 Whoo!
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
Arlo, shut up.
Hey, hey, hey.

Oh.


...-natic.
You got Elvis?!
Stop.

Hang...
Oh, fuck!
Forty-five seven!
What the hell?

You did help a little.
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
That's bullshit.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Yeah.
Be cool.  Be--
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.


And it won't be pleasant. 
...take my sorry old truck.
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
...-lar.
"I am become Death, the...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
...that.
Good to see you again, Leo.
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....

It's clean.
...here!
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Where's their protective...
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
...the river.
...-tainer!





...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
Uh, we both like to fish.
You got thirty minutes.
What's going on, colonel?
Is Elvis out?
That little geek is my...
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
...try this one out some-...
...the master of his realm.
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
The compound has to be kept cold...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Yeah, I just....
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
...tunnel!
You find yourself wearing a...
Got that?
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I didn't sell the boy any...
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
...we're all gonna die in this...
The Army, sealin' us in.
  All right.


Look at that.
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
None.
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
What about her?
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
Oh, my, yes.
Oh they don't?
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
In the garage.
Where's that?
How do they do that?
I get by.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
What are you talking about?
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
Give you three minutes.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
I got your check in the mall.
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
You mean you don't know where you were?
K... Cross.
Another satisfied client?
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Never forgave him for what?
Of course I'm sure.
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
As little as possible.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
...A flaw...
Where are you going?
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
Give me an example.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Upstairs. Why?
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
...no...
I said the truth!
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
When did you come in?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
I'm sorry, I --
I never was.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
It's not completely dry.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
But...
All right, what's your husband's first name?
Yes. No.
Yes.
How did they get it away from him?
They were partners.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
So I can have these? 
But you don't have any kids!!!
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
Will they really find work in Germany?
Now what can you see?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
We'll talk about that later.
Elena!...But when...
So what'd they say?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Charlie?!
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Ask them to sit down.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
I know that, Emily -
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
Oh!!
Oh!
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Would you sing for me?
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
Can't say, sir.
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
Why not?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Why is she leaving me?
You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
Are you sure?
Beats me.
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
That's it, everybody out.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Dick.
Can I use the bathroom?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Such a sordid state of affair.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
There's more, isn't there?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
You work in a market, all right.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Let me take you out tonight.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Stop this. This isn't funny.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Like you're better!
Well, he missed!
Pack of cigarettes.
You're late.
Bunch of savages in this town.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
Did you tell Veronica?
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
Great story, isn't it?
That's frightening.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
Oh yeah.
I'm talking to myself here.
You know what I just watched?
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
She's in here?
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Let's hear it.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
Which ones?
Vermont?
Can you believe this?!
I know.
I don't back down.
Because you buckled.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Sorry.
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Oh, my god.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Bible truth.
Oh, my god.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
His dick was in his mouth?
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
I want to rent a movie.
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
And this is what you rented?
Really?
There's no lights back there.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
Thirty-seven.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
You should shit or get off the pot.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
As if it's that easy.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
Helluva day.
To say the least.
Get the fuck outta here already.
I'm her sister.
You know him?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
What?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Be careful.
I'm trying.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
The white kind.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
What? What is that?
How much money did you leave up there?
Including you?
What the hell was that for?
Why'd you hit me?
Who?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
HOW MANY?
Well...?
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
And that made you feel better?
Would you let me explain...
Randal...?
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
It stings a little.
Here you go.
What's this?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
He only speaks Russian?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Sure. How about the beach?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
You're not?
The guy ain't here yet.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
He knows it well.
Where've you been?
I don't expect you to understand.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
And I can't leave.
He can handle it.
I can't believe you just said that.
Gabe are you alright?
We might be able to go that way.
Pull it apart!
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Never
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Just kidding.
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
It's up there, on the Tower.
Murdering, motherfucker...
He never hurt anybody.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
Right.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Don't use my name!
Is it set?
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
So this is the young man?
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Let me get up.
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
You mean like going to the pictures?
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
But it was horrible.
Just part of hospital routine.
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. What do you want?
Good. I'm glad
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Sixth is faster.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
You need a vacation.
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
No.
Remember what you played?
The crowd had to dig it.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
Twenty five?
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
So?
You guys been holding hands?
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
What thing?
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
I was with Max when he got the call.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
You paid for my flowers?  They're beautiful.  Max, you gonna introduce us?
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
Who is this?
How long you think this'll take?
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
No.  You say you're cool.
Try some deep breathing.
You said you were visiting friends!
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
I need the job.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Let's go.
Show up for what?
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
What happened?
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
And you believe me...?
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
None of your business.
Max?
The sound of love.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Not for years.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
Just relax.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Them who?
Six months.  Eleven days.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
So what's the question?
He's why you punish yourself.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
Connecticut.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Liza?
Did you kill him?
Did you kill my father?!
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  He showed me.  I visited a few times.  Then one of Jonas's guys visited.  When I arrived, your dad was dying.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
How'd you get the picture?
I believe you.
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
And you feel bad for it?
<u>Why you</u>?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
This doesn't make sense.
Agent Lowry.
Do you believe me?
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning...
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
Ellie.
Do you have a minute -- ?
Actually I'm running late --
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
You aren't staying?
Right.  Well.
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Ellie.  Pulsar?
This is how you see the sky?
And a hundred mile airspace.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
Can you show me?
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
I didn't realize I was out.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
And?
It's good to see you, Ellie.
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
You're trembling.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
I can't do this --
Please --
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Meaning...
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
She took off with that convertible feller...
That's good: he earned it.
Comin' out here, Boss?
Please! Please!
Oh lookit that brunette.
A cold drink? Okay?
Somebody say somethin'?
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Where'd the road go?
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
What you mean, Luke?
Do we even get our same bunks back?
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
I'm in.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
I was?  How you spell that?
You get me out first.
I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
You come and visit.
In jail.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
For months... last October.
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
Then what do you need me for?
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
The lock...
It's a woman shot in a car?
Yes.
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
Because it's your job, that's all.
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
I heard. Good police work.
Answer it.
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
Absolutely.
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
There was no sperm.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
Helen Hudson...
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
Detective Niccoletti?
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
It is?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Please finish your story.
What does he want from you?
Crash victim?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I did this already.
Patient.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
How?
Maybe.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Yeah, everything's under control.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
Fuck me.
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
I gather he's late as usual.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
I'll see you soon.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Honestly, Letty.
Don't be fresh.
Letty, you should be in bed.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
Shocking, huh?
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
What else would you do?
Well?
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
How may I help you?
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Sure. Why?
That's a big question.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
Office work?
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
What are you doing?
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
You're there now?
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
Good.   I'm good.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
Someone else coming?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
I assume you want something?
And the other half?
For what?
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Why not just steal another one?
I'm going to kill him myself!
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
You're sure?
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
Can I trust you, Sami?
Does it really matter what I say?
I will.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
Don't bullshit me.
I just thought that--
You said don't do it, boss.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Good song though.
What hotel?
The Holiday Hotel.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
Yes.
No.   How much?
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
Give it to me, Sami.
How?
How are we going to do that?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
And you don't speak French?
And how do we do that?
You like shoes?
Why?
Then leave her to me.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Why do you want to teach me?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
You're home late... or should I say early?
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
You don't seem to understand.
This spells trouble.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Let's end this here.
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I left the training early.
You were enlightened?
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
But don't be too lenient.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
They're gone.
But the sword could be in his compound.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Could be.
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
Fun -- look at that guy...
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
Do you know what you destroyed?
I can see her.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Shelly?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Excuse me?
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
You a lesbo?
Why are you being so dramatic?
I never said that.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
No thank you.
How are you today?
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I don't.
I do not.
Am I bothering you?
I just came to say goodbye.
Where are you going?
How am I a hypocrite?
I love you.
I'm sorry about that.
Schwarz. Jewish?
German.
Are you shitting me?
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Okay.
Does your mother know?
I don't know.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
That's one way of looking at it.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
Want to join me?
I do.
It works a little.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Yes!
Who is this?
No.
Hello.
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Sorry.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Sounds intriguing.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
What are the terms?
I'm working on it.
Call me later.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
What's your plan of attack?
Any day now.
Shut up.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Exactly the opposite.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Ronald?
Well done.
Didn't you hear what I said?
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
Ronald? That's crazy.
I can't thank you enough.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Do you know where she is?
Yes, you already did.
Right after we played backgammon.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
I said, do you want some water?
You're a lucky guy.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
Ronald, I'm sorry.
I love the smell of pine.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Yes, darling.
What's her name?
Irena.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
Will you be friend for always?
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.
Merry Christmas.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
Don't cry, Amy.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
But what happened to the little deer?
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
I've been working out.
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
There was a sale.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Do you really need these?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Holy shit, I don't know.
He's been here all night?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Guess she never found true love.
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
You should have gone at the restaurant.
Uh huh. So pee.
Where'd you get the bike?
On your desk.
Coffee and...
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
No.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
My mom used to get PMS too.
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
Uh.... hi!
Your breasts feel larger.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
We didn't have sex.
Why would you want to be a cop?
He was found a few blocks away.
I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
Madonna's in Penthouse?
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
What of?
Maybe ten minutes...  Thatís strange.
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
The other one?
Just visiting my patient.
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
You typed this report?
What now?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
Yes.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
What does she say?  The woman.
Yes.
If you like.
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
What are you doing?
What are you hiding?
What happened to you?
How do I get there?  Tell me.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
Dave...
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Alan
.. Nothing.
Is that everybody?
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
I'll lock him away for good.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
You could buy it on payments.
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
I'm afraid so.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
Presence.
Dave!
What do you mean you made it all up?
`Dave'?
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
Well...
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
What are you staring at?
... How could I what?
Mind if I sit down?
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
I know. I'm sorry...
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
All set.
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
The hospital? 
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
NOOOOOOOOO!
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
Mary.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Nuwanda?  Please?
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
It's Nuwanda.
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
What happened? Were you kicked out?
No.
This is stupid.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Don't stop.
Stop what?
No.
Chris!
Knox, I don't believe this!
Chris!
Dead Poets honor.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Courtyard?
LOUDER!
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Father!
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
I'll take him over mine.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
From my father and Nolan.
Neil, you're not gonna...
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
I will be with thee straight.
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
Do you have to quit the play?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
And no questions asked.
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
You don't have to be so touchy.
I'm not rich people.
That's what I do.
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
It's not them...it's it...
Yeah...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
So?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
You want 'em?
Yes, Albert?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
What the --!
It's Nick!
I do!!!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Couple of weeks... Listen --
I got delayed. I --
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Where? Where is he?
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
But I insist.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
You like to call me Linda now?
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Holy shit!
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Biederman, yes.
Linda...
Linda... Hey, Linda...
What?
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
What?
You seem... disturbed.
Merle?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
I just wait. You know?
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Hey, Nick?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
What else?
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Merle...
No. No way!
Nick!... I thought you went home.
Watch it, shithead!
No.
What do you mean, no???
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
You're full of shit!
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Up I would say... What would you say?
Down I would say... What would you say?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I'm not voting for you.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
Just great.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
Hey, I'm eating.
You never want to find out.
They always are.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
You could always take it off.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
Young man -- you got me there.
Make them go faster, Mr.... ?
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
What Grange?
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
Mornin', Jabez ...
All right -- so it's buried with you!
I do -- and I think you should too.
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
You know darn well it is.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
I'll get the doctor.
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
You'll never change -- will you?
I'll get it, Jabez.
Well -- I -- I-
What's ailing that dog?
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
You'll be a father any minute now.
I want you to fix these fish!
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
What's that?
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
Me?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
I wanted to give it all to the church.
I'm John McClane.
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
So, why didn't you come?
One of yours?
The police...?
John.
Where are you going?
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
That was tricky, with the accent. I bet you do a great Ed Sullivan. Why do you need the detonators, Hans? I already used the explosives.
Go on.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
So whatsa deal?
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Yeah.  It was terrible.
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
You're really crazy.
I know!
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
I like that... yeah!
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
I don't have a choice.
Are they on the phone still?
What kind of things, Leon?
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
Yeah.
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
Come on.  I want you to see something.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
What do you want?
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
Don't fuck with me ...
Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup!
What's the matter with you?
You got kids?
They look like good kids.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
You got Bank Americard?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Did you always call him Junior.
Because I don't want cancer.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
My body?  What for?
Where's the money?
You mean that?

Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Okay, Sonny.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
I said you were never a faggot.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
I can't, Mom.  If I come out Sal will kill them.
Doing what?
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
<i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
Did it hurt?
You motherfuckin' Tino. You fucked us so bad.
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
Yep.
Where is the money?
I don't know.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
Must you use that awful word?
<i>My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.</i>
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
We're covered on legal with that, right?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
My brother.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
Squash it.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
OK.  OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
How old are you?
My name is Eddie.
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
What are you so worked up about?
He's completely innocent.
...peanuts.
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
Sal, I want my money.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
Hot.  Hot.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
Of course I'm sweating.  I'm burning up.  It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Smack him back.
It's e-vit-able.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
I love you, my brother.
Some are OK.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
You listening to me?
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Then we could try something else.
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
The both of youse, shaddup.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
You're it.
In the new library there.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Come over around seven.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
I know I am, Mom.
Cool.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Who's Principal Collins?
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Exactly! A pirate!
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Shut up!
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
HARRY! I found the treasure!
Cute puppy.
But my mom gave me the map.
Wait, wait!
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
She's one of a kind.
I thought I told you to get lost.
TURK, leave him alone.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
I'm so close I can feel it.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
And, take some more pictures.
Who's there?
What?
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
What happens now?
So, this is Leto the Just...
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
Always.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
The <u>women</u>?
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
I never said I could ad-lib...
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
What is this place?
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
Eddie, you screwed up.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Eddie, how was I?
Um, okay... roll camera
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
These shoes are itchy.
It's that easy?
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
What?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Ed, it was only one review.
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
But there's plenty of other parts.
I told you this was gonna happen.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
You're a fuckin' mess.
But you used to say --
I understand you just moved here?
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
So you're not gonna make the movie?
So you're not a fruit?
OUR picture?
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
The marriage already ended.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Dynamite --
Huh?!
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Yes!
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
Why... yes.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
No! Do they show you having sex?
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Al!!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
What?
No, uh...
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
This guy.
What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
Where are you going?
Yes?

Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Yeah?
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
He made a mistake.
Eddie...
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
But Al is your husband now!
Hi, Mom. 
No.
Dynamite.
You do though, you look great.
Don't defend that horse's ass to me.
Okay ...
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I know, I ...
I really like you too...
Ohh...
I need to talk.
Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
Everybody's someone.
What are you drunk?
Why do you do that?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Great.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Hi, Shari.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
Mm.
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Anything wrong?
What?
Okay.  Yeah.  We know
You're kidding, right?
Looks good to me.
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Thanks for everything.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Hello, Mr. M.
Plenty of pep, too.
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
You'll be fine.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
This weekend.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
Now could you leave me alone?
Till 19-fucking-70.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
It's Lynn.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
One in six.  Where's the girl?
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Dudley's guys.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
Bud...
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
No... Where'd the tip come from?
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
No.
<u>Throwing me</u>?
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
What?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
On what evidence?
None.  Call it a hunch.
Do you have any proof?
Let my Susie rest in peace!
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
Jack!  It's Christmas!
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
Around.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Shut up!
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Really?  How?
Working whores with squad two.
What happened?
DePinto's dead.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
I just gave him my card.
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Turn on CNN.
Clear as day.
When can you get it here?
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
Why?
Who was that other guy?
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
What <u>is</u> that?
What if--
Get dressed. We're leaving.
I called from a payphone!
How'd you have the manpower to--
What do you think?
The NSA killed him.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Where?
Here?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
You sure?
What size?
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
Yes?
Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Because I don't know.
No, sir.
Was he with anyone?
Right.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
Sorry.
Well, you know--
Stacy?
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
It wasn't me.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
What can I do for you?
You don't know who the fuck--
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Brill.
It's how he works.
You're not.
I <u>did</u> care how.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
We'd rather not--
Your shoe.
Hey!
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
What are you talking--
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Did they take your clothes?
No.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
Can I talk to you a second?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Ssh!
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
I'm sorry, man.
Tell me about it.
The police?
Why not?
It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
Yes sir.
What?
What happened?
We'd have to--
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
He had help.
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
What about--
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Puffed cheese?
Then let's assume I don't.
Thank you.
I don't want to go back.
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
You should come into the shelter.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Do they know them?
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
Say you're sick.
Arabic?
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
I'm sorry, Katharine.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Which we've overflown twice.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
How are you?
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
David Caravaggio.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
You were in Africa?
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Hello.
Are you planning to be the exception?
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
What did you say?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
Aren't you?
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you remembering more?
He's Canadian.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
So I follow the wires?
Why would anyone do this?
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
This is hot!
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
Hello miss.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
Pardon me?
Through a window.
The windows don't open.
So he popped the pane?
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
You ordering chop suey again?
And the draft blew over the flowers.
You got a better idea?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Where are you at least?
He's on to something bigger.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
Why are we speaking Chinese?
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
You have a car?
You disappeared.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
You...you can't.
No. Why would I be?
The Empress Death Mask.
And--
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Good morning.
I know it well.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
That's it. We're ready.
Won't take any time.
Aren't we early?
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Careful...careful.
Your share.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
That's where the Mask comes in.
There's always a surprise.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
You shouldn't have.
But would you--would you--
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
What's wrong.
Gin, really.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
You damn well thought wrong.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
You'll just have to have faith.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
What's she doing here?
All of 'em?
Jesus.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
I'm sorry, Erin.
Where's Anna?
Excuse me?
And you can't?
Then I don't get anything either.
That's crazy -- why not?
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
Bullshit.
You think there's more?
You wanna talk about --
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
I like this case.
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
What's a demur?
Not in my world.
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
How do you know that?
You see your office?
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
What do you mean?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
Yeah.  A real moron.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
Hey -- those are my files --
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Which number do you want, George?
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Ten?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
What?  But you been working so hard --
Lock the door.
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
What?
I know.  It's an awful lot.
Will he finish what he begins?
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
You know the Jedi Master?
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
You, too, golden rod.
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
What is it?
How do I look?
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
No lightspeed?
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
I don't like this.
What are you staring at?
You look great.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
I was worried about you.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
Repairs ...
Get out of here, Lando!
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
Jabba the Hutt?
Leia!
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
I feel cold.
What's in there?
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
Did you call the Zoo?
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
Zira, are you mad?
And we can watch ...
What, Lewis?
Go easy, Stevie.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
Who's that?
I tried...
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Don't lie to me.
All right, so I made another deal.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Plissken...?
How do you know all this?
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Where?
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you.
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
So be it, to the death.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
At last...
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
In the great book.
What is this place, Merlin?
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
I left it in the tent, sir.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
--And damsels in besieged castles are waiting to be rescued?
I'm going.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
Why can't you be my champion?
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
And you cannot love me...
Why?
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
Now you must pay me.
The oath. You didn't say--
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Well what's wrong?
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
No, he's working on another book.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
I'm sorry.
Hi, how'd your day go?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
What didn't he tell you?
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Yes, I go now.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
A man to see you.
Fine thank you.
And those lies she's been telling?
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
Did he tell you about my party?
No.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
But how?
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Please.
What's the difference?
You really don't want me to play huh?
Yeah
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Oh you did. What did you hear?
How do you know?
Karras.
Oh, Christ.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
I came to say goodbye.
What's playing.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
You'd like that?
It would bring us together.
Ego te abslovo.
No.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
The Lord be with you.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
I once did a paper on it
And Dennings, you read how he died?
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Sick priest, is that it?
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
No I probably wouldn't.
That's to bad.
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Who?
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
Yes
I'm afraid.
Take it now.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Teeth.
No bones?
Piano.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
That's not the point.
Frank.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Lotta water.
Seeing anyone in particular?
No thanks.
No, I mean it.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Jack.
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
No.
Frank.  Fuck it.  Okay?
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
I'll drop the eighths.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
You leaving that on?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell are you doing?
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
The tenth's out.
What do you mean?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
Stay off it.
How're your hands?
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
Your limo's ready, Ma.
My watch is broken, too.
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
Ready?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
It's orange!
Come on.  We don't have much time.
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
I wear a seven.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Shoes?
Oh, thanks.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Fucking.
Jack, you with us?
Maybe it's legit.
You two could play checkers.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
He's right.
I don't believe it.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
How about you?  Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
What?
Barker.  Jock Barker?
Baker.  Jack Baker.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
Pretty much.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Forget it.
You're upset.
What's that supposed to mean?
The both of them?  In there?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven.  Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't.  Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
Nervous?
So, what happened?
You don't pick your brother.
Yeah.
What kind?
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
How do you know?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Jack.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
And this thing can grow it?
Pollux ...
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
That's not the worst part.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
No.
Whoever you are, don't call again.
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
Would it?
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
You killed them?
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
Kim?
You've got someone in your office.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
Me.  I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Her assistant?
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
What’s going on here?
No.
We’re almost done here...
This isn’t my real life. It’s just a glimpse...
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Like what?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
She wants to have an affair with me.
Hey, is that really necessary?
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
No.
Yes you do...
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
You still think this is about me, don't you?
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
What?!
Why not?
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
Why don’t you let me take this one, Kenny?
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Are you okay?
Look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You’re not wearing that to the Thompsons’ party. I don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
Why not?
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
Wait a second.  You want me, don’t you?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Well...Annie for one.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
How was the game, honey?
Jack...can we afford all this?
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Peter Lassiter...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
No...I’m not...
Don't you have anywhere to go?
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!
Relax, it's casual.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
So are you!
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
They're ready for you, sir.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Ben's still out there --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
What are you doing?
Where do we stand?
The less time, the better.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
I'd hold that off awhile.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
How bad off is he?
Brain injury.
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
You mean <I'm> going along?
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
We're pushing oxygen today.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I can't tell you.
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Then don't drift down further.
No Jean, no money!
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
Wuddya do?  Carl looks around.
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Yeah, you already said that.
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Oh, yah, I know that!
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Mr. Mohra?
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
A subconscious-type thing.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
Yeah, but -
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Ma'am, I answered your question.  I answered the darn - I'm cooperating here, and I...
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Well, what do ya mean?
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
How ya doin', Wade?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Yah.
We're good to loan in.
You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
Hiya, Lou.
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
You don't think he's mixed up in -
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
Yah.
Oh, pretty good.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Anyone else residing there?
Yah, is this Marge?
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
Was it reasonable?
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
What... ?
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Cornelius!  How are you?
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
I'd like to thank the academy...
We need to talk.
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
It becomes an addiction.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
I found a new one.
Like testicular cancer?
What are you doing here?
It's time for you to leave.
What are you talking about?
I don't know ...
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
No, thanks.
You feel nothing?
Whatever.
That... sawing and hammering.
Guy or girl?
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
Is this a trick?
I'm sorry, I...
You are an insane person.
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
Hello?
Is this a test, sir?
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
Being clever.
...no ...no ...
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Is it a problem for you to ask?
What's that?
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Strange.
The fight.
What fight?
Hemingway.  You?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
What are we doing?
Hey.
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
I'm not asking you to.
... is over.
Four in Milwaukee.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
You took me to the house.
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Tyler...
Defuse the bomb, please.
Why what?
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Appreciate something.
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Why?
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What about that?
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Maybe.  What's this about?
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
How do you know?
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
And you're gonna die after me, right?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
What feeling?
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
You guys are real... aren't you?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
You never been in one of those things.
Gawd, you look awful.
Why's that?
Spooks?
You think you are... .
Stay on your heading, Captain.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
Why me?
What?
How long before you're fully on line?
American.  Come to get you out.
Meeting ... people.
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
<u>What</u>!
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
He's not a moron.
... What?... You don't want to commute?
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
You a friend of Parry's?
Where?  Maybe we can.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
It was a crime.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
No... thanks... Listen --
<u>What</u>!?
They said you're The One.
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
The Red Knight!
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Holdin' my penis...
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
I advise you to let us go.
It sounds exciting.
What are we about to do?
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Divorced.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
You just going to sit there?
You treat me like I was.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
I love it.
Okay, Ray...
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
No.
No. We have tomatoes.
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
I don't make the rules.
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Where is she, anyway?
What have you been doing since then?
I guess you fell in the water.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
If you're free.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
You think I'm a fake.
No, don't do that...
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
I'm fine.
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
Catherine...
What?
Robert, I think you better just...
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
No, it's okay.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
No, I wouldn't.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
Well, she was.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Who are you?
Victor.
I, umm, came to see you.
No.  What you do today?
They are?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
I think by Twenty-two.
For real?
Like this?
Your friend must be misinformed.
What?
No.
Where you know Amanda from?
You live around here?
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch F. Fletch
Ask anybody.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, which one?
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Jesus.
Can I get you something?
Oh my God!
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Well, I'm fully covered.
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Check.
He sighs.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
I'm the Sufi.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Why not?
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I'm still here.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Not me.
She's cute as a button.
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
I ordered lunch.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
He never sees them and I never met them.
Who.
So?
What are you talking about?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
No wonder.
So you're saying she moved out.
Fletch.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
I have some ideas.
Get out of here.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
What...
You were going to can me, right?
Jim Swarthout?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
Who?
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
So many assholes, so few bullets.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Thanks for the promotion, man.
All your friends call you Jazz.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Spooky.  I'll process her.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Contacts.
Yeah, let's bury her.
You okay?
Aha, just what I suspected!
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
It's red, Ford.
Because I know rock-n-roll.
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Gut feeling.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
'Booty Time.'
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Let me go out like a man.
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
What about Don?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
You'd said something about proof...
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
I'm still the king!
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
'Bye, Johnny...
What's my name?
Did you pick up the car?
Did they follow you?
I wasn't looking.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
Marseilles.
You want some eggs.
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Toy wit' this will ya.
Yeah.
You want the red or the white?
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Pass.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Hey, bud.
I'm serious.
The future guy?
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Next time lets put some money on it.
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
What?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
I'm thirty-five years old.
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
On the job?
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
Yeah, it's me.
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Are you alright"?
Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
What are we like in...1998?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Yeah, I think so...
How the hell am I gonna do that?
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
Dad, what the hell is going on?
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
How you feeling?
I better give you my address then.
He ain't our guy, John.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Wife around?
A hot shot, huh?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
I vote for me.
A hammock?
Somebody was in here.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
And, what about us?
You know him?
What d'ya got in there?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Yes.
Why do you do these stupid things?!
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
Uh...yes.  But...
Did you hear me?!
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
I've seen it.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
Eight times.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
Twenty.
You need to leave.
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
You're talking about my lady.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Tell me.
Oh my God, Steven.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Are you crazy?!
Oh, my dear God...
How many times do you want to hear this?
I've told you the truth.
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
About what?
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
But she might be in trouble...
A major prick.
What are you going to do?
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
What are you talking about?
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
You have to call the police...
What did you find?
Big mess every time.
Crosstown.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
And he was there?
Is it safe?
Do not inhale.
Don't wait Efor me.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
Paisley Porter.
Great game.
Did you see the winning run score?
This could Pbe it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
This is how we've managed to last.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I have a class. I'm late.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
Who is it?
Where the hell are you?
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
My back is killing me.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
A grandmother. God bless you.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
Because God loves a winner.
Then they lost?
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Postpone. We have every right.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
And he has finer moments now and then.
Say it again.
What?
Alla puttanesca.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
God gave you ten thumbs.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I'm sorry.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
What are you doing?
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
"Hell!"
What can we do?
You've done me a great service.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
Assuming we are in agreement?
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
Er, no...
I like football.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
Surely you know what you have.
We believe we have a suspect.
It's about the Director.
What's wrong with him?
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
German.
It needs work.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
You wish.
It's okay, Eugene.
What makes them think that?
How was your evening?
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Where are you taking her?
You may as well invite her here.
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
How long?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
How are you, Jerome?
Where are you going?
Anything I've forgotten?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
I hope he's not just a body.
Yeah.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Hugo!  I've found him!
Have they found our friend?
You didn't know?
What exactly is wrong?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
--when you go away.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
What are you doing?
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Where did you get them developed?
Assumed name... Houston.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
It's all right.
Really?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Is he straight?
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
Yeah... I know.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Bullshit.
I mean it.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
I don't want to go there.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
A man helped me open it...
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
You want to try with me?
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Can I help you?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Where?
Yeah. I got out.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Two.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
You can trust him...
What's the damage?
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
How?
Yeah.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Where's he living these days?
Can I go now?
I call that regular.
You know Sid Fletcher?
Yes. I met him last year.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
He was here for four days.
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
Entertaining.
I want to give you an Oscar.
I don't know.
Was it Albert?
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
What you having, Jack?
Where you off to?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
I'll call the police.
You wouldn't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
Do you want breakfast?
No. Are you tired?
What you doing around here then?
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Eh? Have a drink.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
What's that? A hundred?
...Polacks...
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
To get on the...
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
Mmm...
...this shit...
You get a bad month, all of a...
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
No.
Yes.
Starting up.
What?
You...
When they...
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Someone should hurt them.
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
Did you talk to Graff?
He'd give me a job.
Yes.
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
No.
...I thought that we were only talking...
Absolutely.
You need money?  Is that the...
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
I was at home, where were you?
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Did they catch...?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
Wh...wh...Wha...?
I want to work today, that's why I came...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Excuse me, fella.
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
I'm out.
I will close.
Because I say so.
Is that what you're saying?
That's alright.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
What are you talking about?
Well, hadn't it?
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Abso...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Because I don't like you.
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
They took the leads?
Fuck you care...?
Oh, Christ.
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
Sure.
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Oh!  For the magazine...
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
What?
Kenilworth.
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
She told me not to talk to you.
And the check is...
It's nothing.
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Guess who?
You just this morning...
We haven't got a lead...
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
You closed him yesterday.
You did?
John...
...Mr. Williamson...
Just a few days.
Why do you have to go?
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
 My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.
That's what I'm here for.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
What's that?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
He's an Italian?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
That's off now.
I'm going to see my parents.
Kay... Kay...
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
He's not the same as when I met him.
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Goddamn it, where were you?
Mikey, I hoped...
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
This meeting is adjourned.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
Does it feel like a boy?
I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
On a plane back to Sicily.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Where can we talk?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
I just left our friend in Miami.
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
I do not.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Are we going to eat or what?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
What makes you say that?
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
Sure.  I loved it.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
I'm not a kid.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
You did not know?
It's not what you think.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
Good morning.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
These are your paintings?
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
Huh?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Broke is more like it.
You went to university?
But why?
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Can I see what you did so far?
What happened?
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
You first.
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
I didn't --
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
No harm done.
I don't hear anything.
Run for what?
You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
The Great War?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
What won't do?
What was that?
Just take off the fucking mask!
I didn't ask George to invite you.
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
Of course.
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
One likes to live simply.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
A boost. A big boost ...
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
Me, too. Every time I walk...
It's about my brother ... Kip...
And this has what to do with me?
You know my back.
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
I guess ...
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
What color?
No. That was Higgins ....
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
Dignity...
How you know that?
Have you seen him?
Atley Jackson came to see me ...
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
Any more, O -- ?
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
You okay -- ?
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
About what?
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
The era when crime didn't pay --
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Where'd you find this one?
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
You want me to buy her?
Where you off to -- ?
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
Six or seven...
She's trouble --
Very good...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
I take out my slim-jim...
Slip it in ...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Not really -
Not really --
What are you doing here, assface?
Look at Jeannie's kid.
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Tell him. It's okay.
Wha?  Me?
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
You want the melon?
Yeah.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
He's with his friends.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
How's the woman?
Why didn't you yoke him?
Ah, history I think.
I guess so.
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Shut up.
Holy shit.
Chuck, let's go.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
What class did you say that was?
History.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Which one's your building?
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Shall we start the, uh...
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
Will.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Yes.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Good to see you.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Why me?
I'll be okay.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Who?
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
He won't be a failure!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
Sean...
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
Who is he?
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
I might understand that.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
What did you think?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
So Christ, call her up.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
Where were you?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
I didn't ask for this.
Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
I know.
It's not your fault.
You're Welcome, Will.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
I've never seen your place.
Fine.
It's important that I learn this.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Then what are you afraid of?
Is that what you think--
Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?
Take care.
Ready, Pa?
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
But ain't no reason--
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--
Lots must a died, too.
Maybe the road's out.
Any gas?
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
Short fella. Pale face.
Kinda pie y'got?
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Want to work?
Four.
Can all of you work?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
Joad. Tom Joad.
You got dances too?
Why, you're the preacher!
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
I dunno. Payin' five now.
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Want to work, do you?
What's the matter? What's happened?
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
What's the matter, Grampa?
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
California.
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
That!
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
They know what--this fella looks like?
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
Yeah?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
Then who *do* we shoot?
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
I wisht it was day.
Man bones?
You people looking for work?
You don't...
Oh... really?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
That's it?
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.
Bad television.
What's that?
You look beautiful.
Which would you rather...?
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
Come on.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
Do you like the people you work with?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Lisbon?
I don't think so.
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
They're not happy, sir.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
What's it look like?
It's fine.
Of course you will.
He sold me this bad boy.
It didn't work out.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
To shoot you. Correct.
How did you get this job?
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
Does Chicago count?
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Mom?
I didn't know I had to.
What?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
Who is it?
How's everything?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
What did he say?
No, let me go.
We're very lucky.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
Aw... that's so sweet.
You've already made arrangements!?
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Good night.
About what?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
How are you feeling about work?
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
Yes?
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
It's so cruel.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
What does she do?
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
What are you looking at, young man?
Well, that'll happen.
Cool?
You think it's cool?
Right.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
That's far out!
Damn!
It was him, man!
Yeah, mom?
Revenge.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Talk to me.
Crash Override.
Two days.
Fucked if I care, man.
Are you challenging me?
And if I win?
We need your help.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Kate, listen.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
I know, I know who wrote it.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
Yeah.
Dade.
You look good in a dress.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
We caught 'em.
Good.
What's happening?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
A hacker planted the virus.
So what are we supposed to do?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
555-4202.
I'll take you down there.
So?
What does that mean?
When did this happen?
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
How do we look?
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Outside.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Jamie!
I've got you come on, go down.
Then we'll be safe?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
I don't know.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Oh Christ. Doc...
How's it powered?
Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah
I know that Mr. Sayer.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Hi, Dad. What happened?
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
We just talked.
What time?
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
Look.
Annie, was that you?
Of course.
You still spooked?
What's the pumpkin for?
Thanks.
Fancy.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
I gotta go.
I found the car! He's here!
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Is Annie around?
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
After the movie.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
Promise?
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
There's nothing else I can do.
PROBABLY going.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Uh-huh.
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
Yeah.
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
No?
Yes.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Well, thanks a lot.
Isn't that beautiful?
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Elliot!  Don't!
Elliot!
Oh, don't say those words!
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
I didn't sleep all night.
This is not an easy situation.
No.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Lee...
Was I?
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
I am... I did slave all day.
Oh, Mom!
Want some coffee or tea?
Me?
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
What are you going to use for money?!
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh, yes, you have!
You've been with someone!
I'm sorry.
I'm saying it now!
Oh...
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Oh, great.
You look so beautiful.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
No.
Really?
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
Gee.
I want to experience childbirth.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Ohh?
Here.  Be careful with those.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Yeah, that's clerical.
What's the matter?
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Yeah.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
No, I haven't.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh, who cares?
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
Okay.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Aren't you glad to see me?
A reward...
Some museum director disappeared.
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
Why me?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Rich, comic book freaks.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
You take this much time over everything?
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Why did he come back?
Where was the call from.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
I've never heard that he...
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
...here's to child abuse!
Mmm...
Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
I said sometime it gets so...
My husband brought it to me from America.
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
How so?
How could you know?
You know America?
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
And you let her get away.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
No, I don't get you...
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
The girl needs help.
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
Don't shoot yourself.
I don't understand.
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
I want the money.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Then what brings you back?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"-- 
Yes.
What is your point?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
What are you gonna do about it?
Mine!
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody. I know                         ] you like to think of yourself as                            ] the Anti-Oberon, but man, you're                            ] getting just as spooky.

You'll be hiding behind a tree.
...sorry...
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
Talia, you're a wonderful person...
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
Don't say that.
It's not my style, okay?
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
What are you doing here?!
Guess who?
Is she dead?
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
And your worst enemy.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Kurt doesn't look too good.
We killed them, didn't we?
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
Can't you see this is a special moment?
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
You can be so immature!
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
I thought I...you..
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
 Got an A, Mum!
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
Well, I guess I take after you then!
What does old Stew want?
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
Look, Mother!
This.
What?
Just a couple more . . .
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Of course, yes.
Second most common?
No.
What?
GWEN?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
What did you just say?
You could say that.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
What's wrong, Trev?
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
You win! Okay pull over.
I thought you loved games.
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
A little? Try unbelievably.
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Two.
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
He waited for you three hours!
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
What is it?
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
That too.
How'd it go?
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
Oh my God!  Bernie!
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Safety?
So where are all your toys?
Let's watch some TV.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
As long as you keep remembering why.
Who doesn't?
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
Baby, what is it?
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Where'd he go?
Neil -- what --
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
He made, you know, a remark.
Honey, are you okay?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
No.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
Who was that?
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
What for, dickweed?
I have a cold.
What did the thermometer say?
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Even better.
Would you?
What do you think?
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Who are you?
Sing.
That is what bothers me.
How long is the voyage?
What are we doing here?
She's the King's cousin.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No.  What am I to do?
This cannot be.
Different places.
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
If it's good advice.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
Is it?
Would you like to see it?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
How can that be?
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
I'm going to my desk.
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Not if they're looking at something else.
There is no way out.
I'm here.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
It won't be a problem.
Okey-doke.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
I can't go without Thomas.
He said something about a girl --
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
The kids are in here!
How about you and your sister?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
Yes.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
Paul, you know who this is?
What's happening?
Anything. Strong.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
What did they say?
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
I led no massacres.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Let's go.
You fucking see that!
The fog is too heavy, sir.
I will need a suite.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
No, no.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
You cannot go alone.
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
Tell me what it was.
What does it matter.
Please, please try one more time.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
We have to have a plan.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Can I help you?
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
So what stopped her?
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- bullshit --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Jesus H. Christ!
Looks like we're it.
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
Don't think it'll be a problem.
Melissa!
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
What?
If you know where it is, get there!
Pritchett!
Prove it.
Why?
I don't think so...
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
Or an on-line computer.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
Don't touch me!
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
What?
Please! Something! Oh-God!
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
He must've unsealed the room!
Melissa...?
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
They don't build them like this anymore.
By freeing them.
What do these ingredients mean?
Can I do it again tonight?
She's here.
Are we going back to California daddy?
Are you playing tricks on me?
What the hell is that?
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
She's gone!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Your daughter's been taken.
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Uh-huh?
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Would you know this store again?
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
What ... What ... ?
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Really?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"You could be swinging on a star."
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Why try?
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word "Fuck" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on "America's Funniest Home Videos."
What the hell....
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
A little petting is not the issue!
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
That's what you theenk.
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
Prison?
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
We're here to say, your government was right.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
Why does this have to be so hard...
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
It's hardly the same --
Oh, no, really, I --
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Oh, Norville --
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Your i --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
As a three-dollar bill.
Watch it, Archer --
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
Just got hired today!
I'm sure you do.
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
...You don't?
Say, that was a swell idea!
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
...education, were you?
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Well, I made the dean's list.
No, sir.
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Damnit, where's my car!
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
There's one in every story.
Thank you for waking me.
What's this?
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
I think you need some help.
I'm afraid so.
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
I've never heard of a cure.
But it's so far away...
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
No, Wes.
It is not beautiful.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
A mental case?
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
It's a starting place.
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Hnnn.
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
A prior engagement overcame me.
What?
Fascist!
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
But...
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.
You're not a psycho!
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Maybe you should have just a half.
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
I don't ever want to see you.
Huh?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
With who?
Right.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
It feels warm.
Nice kid.
I had him!
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
We already did.
Yeah.  All over.
She your only sibling?
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
What are you doing here?
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
He's asking everybody questions.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
Will.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
Stuff.
You're not missing much.
Who?
She used some stupid code name.
I'm sorry?
What about him?
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
Yes.  Like that.
This an accident, Walter?
Nothing if not vampires...
I was waiting for you...
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
I couldn't prevent it.
What night? What do you mean?
But you're the fairest by far.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Stop pestering me then!
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
She's no vampire.
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
But if she dies...
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Take him.
But how do you know?
Lestat - finish this -
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
And they frighten you?
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
You followed me here, didn't you?
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
Can a vampire feel love?
No...
You promise to care for her then?
I thought you were out of town!
There's nothing between Will and me.
No.
Okay, okay. You're right.
Oh!
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Nice move.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
There's no way to lock it.
I don't know...
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Ray...what are you doing?
I love it here.
Don't kill me --
I'm sorry.
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
You sure it's okay with you?
It's...him.
I trusted you.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
How much?
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Not anymore.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
We'll only be a second, okay?
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
) You feel the symptoms?
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
What are you doing?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer —— a correspondent of some sort ——
But one must love a father.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
It was, the plague
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
Yes?
She's not too well.
I've seen men die drunk —- and I've seen men die of the plague.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
I have had command for the last time —-
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
All right –– all right.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
No.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
I . . .
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
I know. I know.
What's that?
Looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Well, sure I do.
Want to give my flower a drink.
There it is, good as new.
It will?
No charge.
Uh-huh.
Came back three days ago.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Yes –– charge.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Some other time, George.
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Yes, sir.
Just a minute –– just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Well, why don't you say it?
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
After that, who cares?
Have fun.
Hi.
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
What plates?
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Throw it.
I don't know.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---
It's still there!
On your own time?
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
If there is, develop it!
Bartending?  I'm 17.
You stay here a minute.
Yeah?
Mike?  Is that you?
I passed out, but I'm okay.
The what?
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Do you?
Carcharadon Carcharias.
Is there one in these waters?
Sound?
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Where the hell were you?
It's good with coffee.
Oww!
Careful.  What's wrong?
I know you did....
What're you going to do today?
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
What for?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Yeah?  Then what?
Now I really want to see it.
I told you, remember?
It killed her.  It ate her.
Get a dance yet?
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
You're going sailing.
Michael....
So?  So?
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
You see the three-quarter socket?
How come?
They're coming with us?
It's romantic down here.
You all right?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
Kathryn...
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
... He ought to put him in here.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
What do you mean, we don't?
How is he?
Me.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
I thought they were clever.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
I'm sorry.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
How's sleeping beauty?
Not at all.
Some miss all their shots.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Believe me, I am.
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
How long you staying?
I don't know, it depends.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Herpes?
Sean, do you have herpes?
Besides that.
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
No, think of something else.
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
It's okay, Sean.
Hold still, damn it!
Yeah, poor bastard.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Polar bears.
Oh...
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
What kind of trouble?
Sharks???
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
How come it's my responsibility?
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
That....
In a minute....
I never....
You're damn right I'm serious....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
You're having a good time....
There's nothing to worry about....
What are you doing?
Where do I pull off...?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
What's wrong?
You're not going to bet it all....
I have coffee in the thermos.
Hurry!
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
You sure you know how to do this.
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
I made them, man....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Forget it....
We got it together, Jake....
What?
How long has he been here...?
I am...You must know something about him....
We lost it....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
I'm coming...How close is it?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
You told me what?
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
Yeah?
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Is it your vehicle?
Did you bring it with you?
I hope I'm not intruding?
Not for me ..
There's nothing in the files?
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
Pay me, and I shut up.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
You don't really believe this?
I dunno what I can do to help you?
You ain't going in alone?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
Three or four.
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
No.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Are you wearing a uniform?
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
Do you pray?
Really? What did he say?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
I know.
Why?
I can't identify him ..
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
What does that mean?
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
Don't ever stop fucking me!
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Well, no you didn't --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Hello?
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
We will be fine!
Well.
Yeah, I did.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Oh good.
What?
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
He's coming over.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
That's the girl I love.
First you gotta tell me something.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
I'll give it everything.
What happened to Denver?
I got it.
At last I find you.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Call me tomorrow.
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
No, I don't know.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Fine.
Beautiful.
Jerry!  You made it --
I have to ask.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
I'm fine.  What's up?
You...
... dick?
You wanted smaller.
-- and I'll get 'em.
You said "fuck".
I don't see any.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Sorry.
Nothing.
What did you say!
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
I don't remember
I thought you were an expert.
How was your trip? Profitable?
We'll be broke in four weeks.
ALAN!
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
I try not to.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
In Costa Rica?
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
Well that's good.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Is there an antidote?
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
We took to the rock.
It has a broken leg!
What do they want?!
No.
What are they?
I think she's with Sarah!
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
You've got to be kidding.
How long will this take?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Why would they care what we think?
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
You can't hold it by yourself!
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
You're married?
What'd I touch?!
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
Hey, we were saving that!
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
I hate trees!
I'm a hacker!
That's not funny.
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
That's not true...
Mister Biller?
Yeah?
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Who is this? What's going on?
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
It's still on.
_Krueger_...
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
So?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
That doesn't make sense.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
You know how to use one of those?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
What's that?
Ten minutes...
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
Another one?
What an extraordinary request!
A true friend would do it.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
When I have no reason to doubt.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
What's the matter with you?
-- You seem amused.
Orlac is an account?
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
Enjoy.  Well --
Yes?
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
I do not love him.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
So do I.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
Oh no, I don't think --
Gee.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Could I ask some questions?
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
I don't see anything, do you?
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
What?
Where'd you spend last night?
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
Well there's a couple --
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
Town Police.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
Mr. Kramer?
Playing.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
Wow!  French toast, really?
What if she forgets?
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
Daddy?
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Good night.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
See you in the morning light.
Objection.
Is that really your chair?
Uh huh...
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Objection!
Did you wish to?
Objection!
No.
Is that...permanent?
I suppose...
Were you?
What?
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Joanna, what the hell is--
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
And?
So...what's so terrible about that?
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Fine.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
No, but--
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
I understand.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Sure.
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Ted.
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Yes, Holiness.
Not the way to talk to people.
But, I am in charge.
General Chiang.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
I will be back in a few days.
How many?
I accept it. What is suffering?
What do you think?
Will we be in this war?
Where is Alsace?
Can India help us?
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
True.
But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Completely.
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
I'll sue you.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
Go!!!
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
Yup.
No!
You ready on shore?
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Oh my God.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
You <u>did</u>, you--
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Well.  Goodnight.
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Well...
No.
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
He just came up screaming.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
Was he swallowed?
You think Jack's handsome?
Are you alright?
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
I had a great time last night. Again.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
Hey.
Kelly--
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
I <u>tapped</u> you.
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
Sometimes.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Why?
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
Sewing...
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
Your bleeding has stopped.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
Killed outright?
No. Tell me why.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
A cattle ranch?
Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this "William Rubin", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
What did you do?
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Starling.
Yes, miss.
Can we rest soon?
Why didn't you bury those people?
Well that is to be expected. My father...
Your "father"?
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
He did?
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
How did you learn English?
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Because what I am interested in is right here...
Are we safe?
There was no letter.
You do not know what you are saying!
You still have an aversion to the water?
Some say that's the way of it.
"Some"?
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
Any powder?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
And what is that?
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Wampum?
What is enough?
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Their arms?
Qui vive?
Le mot d'ordre?
La victoire.
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
We're getting out of here just in time.
Go on!
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
That was a loud one wasn't it?
How much time does that give us?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
You got money in this tub?
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
So that's all you do?...
Typhoon?!
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What on earth's the matter with you?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
Don't spend all day down there.
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
Like what?
You get the guns?
There were two old guns there; where are they?
You fucking well have to get 'em!
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
Yeah, one of them's out.
Out the back.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
You got it all?
Go on.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
Twelve.
How the fuck should I know?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
How do you think you're going to make a living?
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
Why don't you start with that?
You know the popular version of how he left town.
Colt Peacemaker.
Just wondering.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
You were in a fight--
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
No sir.
You know who I am?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
What?
Cliff--
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
If the next guy's a redneck.
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
This is an official visit, then--
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
We don't need a new jail.
When we backed you--
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Never heard from him again?
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
Besides my father, I mean.
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
Morning, Hollis.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
If you spent a little more time training them--
Why would I want to go there?
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
Yeah.
Nice-looking kid.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
I should get back.
Pilar--
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
Pilar--
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
The shooter local?
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
They got telephones.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
Yeah. It's quiet--
Hell of a spot to put a business.
No--
Mister D'Amour?
How?
D'Amour.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
What is he?
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
Yes.
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
You don't?
And you don't ask questions?
When do you want me to start?
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
Why?  Because he had you?
So why did you marry him?
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
Quaid and Jennifer--
Harry-?
Somebody killed him.
Where the fuck is he?
Are you finished with me?
We've never met.
I'm here to offer you a job.
Mine.
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
Are you a gambling man?
Was that Swann's idea?
Does anybody?
At birth.  I don't know you --
Are they all in the business?
Have you been in?
How the fuck do you do that?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
Yes?
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
What did you study?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Hans was very attentive to you.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
We established that we have no communication.
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Mr. Harris?
Yeah, its really different here.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
What?
Oh, come on.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Evelyn Waugh?
How'd it go today?
I don't know what to do.
Lauren?
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Uh..thanks.
Bad?
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
I'm still shaking.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
What a...jerk!
Yes.
It's nothing.
My secretary?
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
He will.  He has great faith.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
Why are you doing this to me?
Father, I'm right here.
So...we won?
How many weeks are you honey/
What's his name?
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
I do.
What do you mean?
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
Yes, I know.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
Are you alright?
What about after?
We need all the help we can get.
You know what?  You can go.
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
Would you sign it for me?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
What?
How is he?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
No I don't.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
No, I mean I can check it for you.
That was nice.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
Hello.
It means a lot that you came by.
That too tight?
You do.
Too many times.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I want to ride my own bike.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
So she's honest.
Hey.
Why?
What was that about?
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
You weren't at my game.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Cheap date.
You don't think so?
Yup.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
So why'd you give up ball?
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
How was your game?
Said he'd be home later.
You came out early.
I just told you.
What's Mom think?
Still is, so let yourself out.
Lucky kid.
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
No need for braces, Donnie.
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
I'm here, I'm listening.
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
GET THE FUCK OUT.
OPEN THE DOOR.
...yeah...
For what?
What?
Yeah, but I don't know --
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
You don't have a boyfriend?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
-- do you wanna cup?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
No.
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
Why not?
Let's make a deal.
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Yeah, of course.
I'm sorry --
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
-- what kind?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
What happend?
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
....do you know who I am?
Picky, picky.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
What is that?
I need to sit down.
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
Yeah.
There's no asshole like you.
...I can't hold onto this anymore...
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
Twelve.
Is this 509-9027?
I'm gonna start rolling --
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Go ahead and waste your time.
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
Where are you from originally?
I'm sorry.
I wouldn'tve asked --
...this close...
It's not your given name, right?
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
Are you asking me a question?
...ok...
Calm down.
There's no disturbance.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
I preffer to stand.
I didn't do anything.
Been drinkin' today?
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
Then what?
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
What happend to you?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
I'm drinking.
Come home soon after the show.
No one else that I know?
How long with Ellen?
What about now?
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
No.
Yes.  What's your name?
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
You need to sober up.
Linda --
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
Pink Dot.
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
What do you do?
I'm fine. nothing.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Stand up.
Alright.
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
..sorry...
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
...what...?
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
What is that?
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
More wine!!
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
But -- what is he doing?
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
Forgiveness.
Mother of God!
No, not Louis!
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
I heard your playing.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
Your Majesty...
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
Continue.
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
Did you know... about Raoul?
What can I do for you?
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
You mean shut your ass down!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
What?
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Did he harm the girl?
And what did he do to the girl?
He said he was following up some lead.
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Speak of the devil.
Up north.
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
Oh man...what happened?
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
I've got a better idea...
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
How about Marvosa and the others?
Where are you going?
I'm stranded out here.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Where?
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
Read it.
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
No other possibilities?
See? You do know something about him.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Get me a plane...
Wait, Will...
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
There's no connection between the families.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
It does, doesn't it?
Parking permits...
What?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
How did you come to Gateway?
Reba...
You'll come by?
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
Do you feel privileged?
Yes.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
No. I don't want to see you.
You'll let me go now?
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
No.
Can you read it to me?
Linda King's desk.
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Yeah...
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
He's very strong physically.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
What the hell can I do?
At the store. You doin' some good?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
Will?  You could come up here.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Meet point's up ahead!
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
You went in the apartment?
I thought you would have some ideas.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
That's interesting.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I don't have one right now.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Why does it feel good?
You got it.
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
George, I hate sitcoms.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
Those are my terms.
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
I can't move my arm.
Excuse me -- ?
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
You're NOT DYING!
You're not listening to me --
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
It's so dirty.
I, I was asked to do this material - -
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
It is apparently not working.
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
We had a deal!!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
So your name's not Gorsky.
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
Who is it?
You're two hours late.
If you get caught using that --
There's something about him, isn't there?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.
... yes.
What are you doing?
I need an exit!  Fast!
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Who's coming for me?
Stand up and see for yourself.
... Yes.
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
The Matrix?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
... am I dead?
Why do my eyes hurt?
Do you know why you didn't make it?
Of the Resistance.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Did you believe in them too?
Now left and that's it in front of you.
What's funny?
How do you know that name?
My name is Trinity.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
What happened?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
No, you... have to be.
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
Why?
Neo, how did you do that?
Can you fly that thing.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
What are they doing to him?
How?
How much time?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
What are you talking about?
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
Tank, you're hurt.
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
What just happened?
What are your plans?
No.
Why?
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
Look at her.
Get out of here before this really goes up.
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
And say what?
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
Don't promise...just deliver.
That's not going to help.
Shut up!
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
What's a'matter?
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
$20.
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Please take it.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Scumbag--
Hey... you got stereo.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
From the Korean War.
Annie made them.
What about the Mayor?
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Drew, you're out of line.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Thank you for coming.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
It doesn't matter.
No, I don't --
As close as a deal could be.
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
And what do I get?
Are you?
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
But I didn't mean to do it!
What you then?
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Can't, sistah.
My Doctor Lady?
She knows you real self?
Sure.
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Yes?
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Yes --?
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
Very well, I'll watch.
Whatever you do.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
I don't know.
No, I'm not.
...No.
I loved it.
For how long?
I like you in a black tie.
'Love will find out the way'?
It's a saying.
Did I say that?
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
Bill --
There's one to every rule.
Now I'd like to be alone.
That's okay.
I'm not hungry.
Thanks.
I think you heard me, Bill.
Which is what?
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Yes.
Speak up, please.
Where are you?  Are you there?
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
Where are you?
Yes what?
How're you doing--?
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
You think Drew will go for it?
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
You like him, don't you?
What were you going to say?
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Daddy, what's the matter?
That was wonderful.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Then what is it?
What was that?
My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
No --
21.
39.
66.
Slam it?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
Hiya.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
My wife.
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
I like your car.
Thanks.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
Don't say anything else.
You don't remember me.
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Yeah.
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
I wasn't helping you for money.
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
What happened?
I'll go see him.
I told him about your car.
What does he want?
I'm not.
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Calm down.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
My wife.
You're the memory guy?
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
Thank you.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Who?
I don't think so.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
So was he scared?
So what are you gonna do now?
Prove it.
Unfinished business.
Why's that?
She has no idea who I am.
Why are you following me?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
Your name's Teddy.
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
Sal Maguda.
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
We're not certain...
I don't know.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
No.
You know how improbable this is...?
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Hola, chica.
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
What...?
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
What is it?
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Where'd you go?
Verdado.
We're makin' moves on each other.
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
I am asking.  You to me.
Then you should.
This is Agent James Fujima.
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
How will it stand up?
On the phone.
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
Where are you?
Alonzo...!
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
Yeah?
I can tell, can't you?
Yeah, oh yeah.
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?
For what?
Forget it.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
What?
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Uh, yessir.
Gonna be like money from home.
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
You got it.
Where?
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
How's your hernia?
Who?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Where are the minefields?
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
And you?
A hundred grams.
There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
You got your stuff?
Yeah!
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
I want to cut his throat.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
Work, work, work, that's all do
Lawyers?
Hey, you can't...
What's your name?
Lady...
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Peter...
You feel anything?
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
I heard how you talked to him.
Great crowd.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
No, Jesus, no.
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Ah...
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
I'm not much of a critic.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
If you wouldn't mind.
Nothing.
No, what is it?
Pretty rough so far.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
The profanity bothers you?
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
You want me to burn my book?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
Then light the match, Paul.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Set what up?
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
You really think so?
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
I'm glad you like it.
Could be the weight of the snow.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Just leave it, all right?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
Did they win?
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
How grateful?
How do you that.
Then don't say it.
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.
What are you talking about?
It is, Billy.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Would you mind if I'm on top?
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
I don't.
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
Much.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Just like old times?
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Like what?
Like?
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
'Terrorists?'
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
I don't think I can get her to do it.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
But why tell us?
Krieger can get it.  Right?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
Take off your coat.
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
May I come in?
I didn't say that.
I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
Whoís dead?
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
I donít think so.
Yes.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
Yes.  I see your point.
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
IMF mainframe.
Sorry, am I interrupting?
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
Why not?
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
Jim, itís over.
I don't know.
Jack you're so wicked.
Such a nice ass.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
Rita. Pass the wine.
Thank you, Rose.
Have I been a good wife?
I have my eyes open.
You did this once it didn't work out.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
I won't come.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
He did?
Yeah, this is Ronny.
He's in Palermo.
Maybe I should come back another time.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Loretta.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Seven years ago.
Just Johnny.
You don't know nothing about it.
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Son of a bitch!
What?
What did you do?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
I'm afraid of who I am.
Ronny!
I got things to do.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
Will you marry me?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
I have no secrets from my family.
And who's gonna pay for that?
Why not?
What! How do you know?
Are you drunk?
It was a miracle.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
What about the moon?
Did you see it?
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
You should think about this.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
I came right from the airport.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
My mother's recovered.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Good.
I'm sure she did.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Sorry. That was rude.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
You were a tiger last night.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
She's got it.
Burn her anyway.
I see.  Yes, of course.
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
Yes!
Please!
King of the WHO?
No one live there.
We want ... a shrubbery!
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
And not too expensive.
Yes ...
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
Hello.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
By what name are you known?
Behind the rabbit?
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
I'm thirty-seven.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Shut up!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Thanks very much.
Farewell, Concorde!
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
No, not anyone else - just me.
We're coming with you.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
He's come to rescue me, father.
Stop saying the word!
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
The good-looking one.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
She'll be worried about me.
You should have someone look after you.
I hope to go up next year.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
How will I know?
I need a man who knows where I am.
Awaiting my orders.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
I wouldn't know.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Then I envy yo.
Why?
For Her Majesty.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
They aren't as watchful as you.
She'll never understand it.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Yes, ma'am.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
They're ready now.
Must they always follow us?
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
I came as quickly as I could.
Yes.
So?
You can't know that for sure.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Where did you find it by the way?
I'm sorry, ma'am?
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Unwell?
Who told them that?
What is it?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.
Talk to me.
Change the channel!
Then leave her.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Yes I am...
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
The clock's already ticking.
Go for it.
Is that your question?
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
I'm thinking!
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
"Escape"?
It means she's screwed up.
Can you say anything but "cool"?
So start at the beginning...
Give her a chance, will you?
I know.  Where are you Adam?
What do you mean "you know"?
It's been a very strange day.
So what's the problem?
There is no problem.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
No, I don't.
I told ya.
Your Aunt called me.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
There was an accident. I came here.
Betty Elms?
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Yes, there was.
Yes?
Diane?
What do you mean? You're Rita.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
Rita... I know what you're doing.
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
Yes, Sir.
Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
You're so easy.
I just wanted to come here.
I had a dream about this place.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Hardly.
Why should we trust you ?
What about Matt ?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
Now where do we go ?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
I'm working on it.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
I'm listening.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
What about you ?
What are you DOING here ?
Yeah a real shame.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
What ? Are you my mother ?
Trust is earned not given away.
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Of course.
I am thirty two.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Sir ?
Zachary.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
Sir ?
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
Look ! Look !
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
No.
Why don't you shut up now.
You had to remind me?
Umm, where do you want this?
People said she looked like me.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
What do you remember about her.
Suspended from school, my mother??
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Okay, no problem.
Visualize a spare?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Seriously?
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Totally.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
How about a nice glass of milk?
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Sure am, who are you?

Come on in!
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
Then what did she do?
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
O.K. Thank you very much.
He's writing. Hello?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
What difference does it make?
I'd never do that.
You would.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
It's not his fault!
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
Yeah?
Write me a poem?
For the mini-bike fund.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Well I'm sort of involved.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
Shelly?
Did it hurt a lot?
He is?
Arthur!!
WHAT?
The boss is watching us...
Ex...ex, ex...
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
What's that?
Oh, how do you mean?
Yeah.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Dad?
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Dad?
I love this guy! 
When??
Yes..
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
Why not?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Sure.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
For this class?
I wrote a poem too.
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Do you think she is?
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Really?
He's allergic to everything.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Are you married?
No.
The boys at school don't think I am.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
NO!
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'm eleven and a half.
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Oh no!  UUH.
No.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
Woah!!
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
Run faster they're after us!!
I am running faster!!
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Get up!?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
No, I'm hiding out.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
For what?
Yeah, it's in the contract.
I should look different.
What?
Needs salt.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
I have a suggestion...
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Try less appropriate.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
I was gonna predict that.
I've missed a step.
Ju...
But he always says...
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Quite the little eccentric.
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
Jules, what's wrong...
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
Lower.
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
Well, if that's the way you f...
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
What do you really want?
Well, I just thought I'd call.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Whose word?
His Word.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Who the hell is he?
What!
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
How much?
Okay.
Howdy.
Hey!
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
Who's that?
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
Well, he's really amazing.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
She had on high heels?
We don't mess with accessories.
Parts.
Mom?
The car broke down.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Does their hair fall out?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Okay. I'll be talking to you.
Bye.
When did you start singing?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Linnea?
I'm not sure. Where?
How old are you?
Oh.
Premeditated murder.
They said go see the chaplain.
Hello.
Oh, no.
For him?
An album.
Where's Bill?
Oh?
Did it break?
Hello.
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
Who?
Ryan O'Neal.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
You want a ride into town?
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
By all means.
Who's the song bird?
It's video.
Ready.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Whose ratings were higher?
Yours.
What I'd like to do---
Not to anybody. She sings.
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Says the United States of America.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
They've hypnotized the nation.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Just for fun, I guess.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
That's my opinion.
Roger, no.
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
Why?
I see.
Really?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
I can't do that. Five guys.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Want me to come?
It sure is.
See Duff. He's the money man.
You think so, Frankie?
I said: Cut it out!
What d'you want?
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
I been sendin' her money.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
People seen him 'round.
Don't say much, do you?
Thanks.
Guess so.
And his age?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Get out of here!
That's why you come back, huh?
Not here, Duff.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
'Been up north?
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Are you married?
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
I'll have some coffee, please.
What's wrong?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Everything you cook is good.
Am I as good as they?
You still didn't answer my question.
They won't.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
About ten dollars.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Duff, I love you.
I don't think that'll happen.
'Round town.
We was just leavin', fellows.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
I heard you.
That's right.
How you doin', boy?
What did you say, boy?!
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
How are you?
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
I understand.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
Are you even really alive?
The words?
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Ready?
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
Never heard of him.
Yo.
How are we doing?
We got problems topside.
Yo.
It's coming.
You haven't got it?
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Case...
Case... it's four a.m.
What?
YOU DID.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
You're Pam?
Forget it.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Wow. It's packed.
George! What are you doing here?
Wings?
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
A--flack jacket.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Oh my god.
Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
I-
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Oh I don't think so.
This seat taken?
When are you going to open your eyes?
Well, are you here with anybody?
No, I'm alone.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
You were attracted to me?
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Yes.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
That is so sad --
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
No.
Uh-huh.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Oh, come on Dad...
What are you talking about?
Wanna join your little friend?
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Are you nuts or something?
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
I figured you might like some help.
I think it's sad...
Are you sure?
What is it?
yeah, I had a bad night.
Huh?
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
What's that?
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
Good morning, Jennifer.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Research.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
Freddy?
Nancy!
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
So?
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
A little basic, but nice.
You got five minutes.
It's been a long time.
Ms. Thompson.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I'm in.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
Fifteen million dollars.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Thank you.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
I thought you were leaving.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
You've got to go.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
What do you think?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Okay.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
What?
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
I thought I'd give it to you.
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Shame!
Di Caprio.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Ah... yes, enormously.
Any bit in particular?
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Max.  This is Anna.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
Well?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
No, sir.
Can I help you?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Try 'Flintstone.'
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Why not?
Are you sure you...?
Fabulous.
What?
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
No, Miss Ratched...
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
A vote is before the group.
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
You men remain seated!
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Yes, ma'am?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
A bus?
Yeah, kid?
What is it, kid?
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
They went that way.
There they are!
Yeah, where we going?
What for?
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.
Why not?
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Jesus God...
That's correct, Doc ...
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
What's the horse pill for, honey?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
What's going on?
Oh, yeah?
Ten bucks.
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Huh?
Is everything all right?
At this hour?
Is he in an asylum?
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.
So, what's the story with your friend?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
We found each other, didn't we?
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
Your great aunt.
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
NO.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
He's out by the pool right now.
Right now?
Do you want me to do it?
What?...
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
You're Damon Bradley?
Been here long?
Just since yesterday.
Yes?
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
I know.  You're right.
What about your job?
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
Now what do we do?
What?
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
You think he misses me at all?
That was a long time ago.
What?
No.  No, you go ahead.
Peter found him?
Kate is that you?
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
And you are?...
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
You miss me?...
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
What?  You know him?
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
I'm not thirsty.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
But my own kid bro—
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
What happened?  What happened?
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work— with all them muscles. 
I want to be a teacher.
Man, you were a mess!
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
How would you've done it?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
What for?
How do you like that one?
Want to go out and have one with me?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
What a fruitcake you are!
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
And if you don't?
What are you going to do?
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
It's true.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Get away from me.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Thanks just the same.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
—It started as a favor— for my brother— you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no— a favor— Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but— Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it— stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away— and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
What are you going to do?
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers— and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you—  — Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
Now don't give me a hard time.
This is my business.
Give me that gun.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Waterfront— Crime— Commission— ?  What's that?
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
You'll work.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Better.
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
I— I musta counted wrong, boss, I—
I— I was just on my way up, Johnny.
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
Maybe I will— one of these days.
Listen— Nolan—
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
If I could get my hands on you...
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
You do?
You're talking nonsense.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
But they are not yet one of us.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
We don't know of anything, Master...
I could make her another Cleopatra...
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
What're you talking about?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
You're good.
You did work for Emil, right?
I'm not dressed.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
I'm a tourist.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
How long you talk to her?
Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
They look like plain old rocks.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Shut up.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
How are you, Raymond?
Quite a mess.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Hello?
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
I mean, romantically.
What, as a sales rep?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
You were going to see her?
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
You just did, for Christ sake.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
You think he's lying?
I see better with them on.
When?
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
I know what you're talking about.
Of course not.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
You goin' right back to work?
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
I'm not leaving Midge.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
You don't remember me, do you?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Why's that?
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Thing I'm worried about is you.
What-- when?
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
Flyweight.
You're not my type.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Technically.  They're separated.
He's about to.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
What'd I say?
What are you thinking about?
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
What?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Midge.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
I think he must've fell in.
Only when I'm n-n-n-
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Land of the free...
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Yeah.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
I was grieving too.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
I'm out of ammo!
No.  You're trying to beat me.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
It must of been a convincing letter.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy—five? Eighty?
I'm not telling.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
They're waiting. Come on.
Where is it?
I don't get it.
Just what you underlined.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
That's disgusting!
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
You really love me, don't you?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Charlie. About last nights..
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Oh, Charlie.
Charlie? Was I dead?
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
What would that be, sir?
Did you study for the test?
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
What are you shooting for?
Don't you get along with your parents?
It's Charlie!
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
All right. But this better be good.
This morning was good.
The hat business is in trouble.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
What about?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I'm just happy to see you.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Am I dead or not?
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Give me some credit, will you?
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty—fifty.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Hi, Richard.
What do you know about hypnosis?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
Silicon is from sand.
I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
What?
All set?
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Zowie...
What did?
You want me to help?
What do you mean?
How did it go with your father last night?
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
It could be parasites, an infection...
You're going to the office?!
What's wrong with you?
Close the law book.
That's not what I said.
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
Correct.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
What?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
I suppose you could say that.
Are you a good lawyer?
Yes. On my torso.
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
What?
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
Gay movies.
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
No.
In some situations.
Absolutely.
Answer the question, please.
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
We're going to draw blood.
I might.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
What kind of people?
Probably since she was born.
Fine, Joe.
Don't know, Joe.
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Let's continue.
Jesus.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
Get out of our way.
You sure you can keep --
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Not sure. Ten?
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Well, don't ask me to.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Little ratty-ass.
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
What the hell's it matter?
We're just burnin' light here.
We aren't completely stupid.
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
What?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
How did you know we'd come here?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
Look -- she remembers.
The blood transfusion.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Now, just a minute --
The evidence was very meager --
How did it go?
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
He's trying to form words.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
With one of them.
No.
What about it?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
What is your proposal?
Yes.
Maybe not.
We can't.
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Taylor! Francis!
...beautiful night.
Nah...
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
You wanted to see me sir?
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Well..
Very nice Mitchell turns.
I'm supposing.
I haven't been invited.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
How long would that take?
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
What did you say his name was?
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Dance?
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
Bad enough.
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
You don't know who he is?
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Nothing matters.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
And Betty Mayfield--
In a way.
It buys things, just like any other kind.
He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer or ale, Miss?
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
The police always do, don't they?
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
This isn't a very good place to talk.
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
To do what?
I know that.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Leave that one lay.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
In case you want to have us followed.
I don't.
I never notice the view after the first week.
A couple of hours.
The only answer I have for you.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Lay off, can't you?
I don't think you locked your door.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Go live in a tent.
What do I get for it?
You in charge here?
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
You can find out.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
It does.  May I go now? 
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
But you still think she's innocent.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
How about your new friend?
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
...break away completely from--
Are you going to have coffee?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
Both dead.
Who?
I have to be up early. 
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
Did she talk about me?
Shall we have a drink or something?
Not here.
Not yet you know any of these people?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
It's shit.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
What would you call it?
U-huh.
You're so famous now.
You'd look naked without one.
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
Don't you gamble?
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
How you figure?
Ever done this before?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
You never were...
Sir?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Oh well he must be a surfer.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
The hell are they?!
This gonna take long?
Who's the girl?
Look at you.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Well, I saw you and--
What do you mean?
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
Any sign of the hostages?
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Please, we hardly know each other.
<u>Expected</u>... offer.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
No.
New York.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
So do day jobs.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
I never joke about money.
No, but it's getting there.
Fine.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Diet coke.
Do you plan everything?
Let's talk some more first.
Uh-huh.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Did you sleep well?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
Vivian --
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
I got a dress, yeah.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
What id we run into someone I know?
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
You won't.
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
Did you?
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
What did you do to him?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Right.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
Why do you want to know?
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
What!?
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
All this because of that whore!
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
In Beverly Hills?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
It was great.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
What kind of school?
Kit give me nothin'.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I leave extras, miss.
What's your name?
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
I don't think it would fit you.
He will come for me.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
Nothing you can say will upset me.
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
What?
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
I thought I was going faster.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
He's really very short on charm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
I don't think more than ten.
-- what? --
But you don't know where he is.
Where did you get that?
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
It won't be easy, Sire.
No.  To the pain.
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Why? You can't even lift one.
He's already dead.
Sixty-five.
Sorry.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
-- get back, witch --
Think it'll work?
You feeling any better?
A little bit.
Guess what.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
"Of the silvery moon,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
Yes sir.
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
But that's cheating!
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
I'm not going to jump on you!
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
Coney Island??
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Yes.  We would!
But he has long hair!
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Get car.  Get car.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.
Of Siegfried...
Hindenburg...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
We won.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
I'm not the police.
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
How early?
What do you mean?
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
How did she pay you?
Cash.
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
Of course not. Please.
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
A lot?
Lila.
I was getting to that!
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Who's he?
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
You can't go up there.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
Sam!
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
You can't laugh at it, huh?
No.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
You have a vacancy?
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
You go out... with friends?
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
That's it. 
You slept here all night?
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
Please... I'd like to go...
Is there?
We have a problem.
Recluse. Kinder word.
I'll get your bags.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
You didn't find anything.
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
No-
That sounds to me very remarkable.
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
Well, news of Buckley?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
That called ... commanded ...
There's no child here.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
I think so.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
What do you mean police dog?
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.
That happens to be the truth.
Why?
Heaven knows. A lot.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
Shall we unpack it?
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Where to?
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
I've been dreaming about this.
Well, I got to see her.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
But who were they?
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
But Rose...
Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Daddy, what's the matter?
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
What are they doing?
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
She's putting the titty back.
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
Then why does she act so dumb?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
No, son, she is dead.
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
I think we both know her.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Oh. Did you say something?
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
What time is it?
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Is anything wrong?
No, sir.
You're so sweet.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?
Well, it was a silly question.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Um-m, well...
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
What's the matter with him?
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
That wasn't my fault.
Sons of bitches!
I can work this.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
The booze.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
Happy Independence Day.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
Birth control's important.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
General Jim Beam, then.
There probably is.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
He went to pick up lunch.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Well, sir...
It's our job.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
You think this is so easy?
What... ?  Not you too?
Just got here.
How'd we do?
We're screwed.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
Know what I love about dynamite?
It's one of a kind.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
I can't see.
Where am I?
Han!
Someone who loves you.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Quiet.
What do you remember?
He's my father.
Your father?
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Oh. Well, yes.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
You promise you won't tell?
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Janet.
I've got something to say.
Uh huh.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
Weiss.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Was all I had to say
Oh, no no, no no.
No no no no.
Are you - giving a party?
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Do you have a phone?
D'you really wanna call?
You sure?
It's only temporary.
They're all the same.
Like?
Sharp -- Real nice.
...What?
...I can't beat him.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
Oh, Rocky!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
Don't talk like that to him!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
...Stop jivin'!
Damn.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Kiss my ass.
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
...That's an old one.
Cost ya a buck.
That's ten bucks.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
What's ya name again?
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Hey --
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
I said, how ya feelin'?
Yeah.
...What?
...Who'd ya fight?
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
How do you mean?
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Whatta' those?
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
Ya really like her?
I'll tear his head off.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
What was <u>that</u>?
What the hell's a freeway?
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Where is he?
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
Doom.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
Aah!
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Does this help?
Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
If I don't make it back here by ten...
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Out--
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Young Romeo is it?
Where is my Lady's lord?
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
Do you have it?
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
Nobody's saying they don't.
I better be getting that.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Where's the case?
Here's yours.
Where's my information?
We'll die if we stay here!
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
A means to an end, is that it?
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
You should really let a doctor look at that.
Yeah.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
Gets the job done.
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
Same thing, isn't it?
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
Lovely, isn't it?
How did you know?
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
What's going on?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
It was at that.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
And what job is that?
I'm going with you.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It is at that.
Give me a cigarette.
Just like that?
And now...
Gaelic.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Never heard of it.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
No.  We can't.
Why?
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
It's the right thing to do.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
He's going to be trouble.
You're out of your mind.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
Do you have everything?
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
It's NOT too late!
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
What are you proposing?
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Shut up, Jesse.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
What's wrong?
Yeah I'm fine.
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
How the hell did he find it?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
Hello.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
No, I can't say that I have.
C?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
She's not his type.
Jesse?
What are you saying?
I didn't say that.  You did.
Dwayne put the gun down --
Dwayne please calm down!
I'm not asking.
Hi ma.
And what happened?
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
Yeah.
This isn't right...
I'm not getting an answer.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
Invitation, please.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
This is your ship?
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
I have plenty of dates.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
How do you know?
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
There's people up here!
Well we're not friends.
Fine.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
Steamed dumplings?
Hello, Benjamin.
Carter...
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
I need your help.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
No.
We are both full of shit.
Where were we?
What about them?
Shortcut?
The license!  You get it?!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Stool pigeon.
You talk too fast.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
No, fish is a PM food.
What?!
What are you doing here?
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
How'd what go?
You don't like it?
You OK?
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
It's Griffin.
You have what I asked for?
I would like one of my people to help.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
What is he up to now?
You don't understand this guy.
Of course.
"Sink the putt."
Maggie!
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
They made me put my hat back on.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?
We'll see.
I think so.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Of course.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Can you fix it?
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
You humiliated me!
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
So am I.
I'm listening.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
He's got a houseboat.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Who is it?
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
That doesn't make any sense.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
You're a basket case.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
Can too.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Thank you.  I love you.
You don't know who she was, Annie --
M.F.E.O.?
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Go home for the weekend.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Are you Annie?
Magic.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Mom, we already...
Sure you do.
Hello.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
Dad, could you close the door?
You think so?
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
It plays in 50 states.
What?!
Oh, you're changing your mind --
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
English muffin.  How do you do it?
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
Bye bye blackbird.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
This is a good letter, Dad.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Was Mom an adjustment?
Are you going with her?
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Did too.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
It's a little derivative.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
No, Estellita.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Yes.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
What can I do for you?
Did you see his hair color?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
Nothing.
I can't leave.
And you admire that?
What is wrong with you?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
We been through that.
I need my paycheck.
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
Nice day
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You're going to have to explain that one.
He doesn't have one.
Can I ask you something?
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
I can't tell you.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Not bad.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
You go, boy.
When?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
What? Is it bad?
The Mexicali Boys
What?!
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
I'd love to hear it.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
Glad of it.
I heard.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
The men said, nine.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Goddamn it, sir...
Captain, what about our deal?
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Hell of a mission.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
I don't think so, Captain.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Don't do that again.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
Frogs?
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
How do you do it?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Because he's guilty.
Hi.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Gee, it's easy.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
Look at those eyes.
Lloyd.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
They really applauded you today honey.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
I'm sorry.
What?
Morning.
I'm fine.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
No, but you stole from them.
I made their lives better.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
Hi.
This is me telling you about me.
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Well...
Eight.
Keymaster?
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
Yeah.
Okay, bye, I will.
It's okay, everybody does that.
Yeah.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Am I wrecking my car?
You're cold.
I think that we should spend some time apart.
What's wrong?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Yeah.
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
So what's up?
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
I called her up.
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
What -
Luck.
Scherner told me something else about you.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
You asked for shoe polish.
Like this?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
What's wrong with it?
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
Pistols?
What others?
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Christmas presents.
I'll talk to you later.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
He's broken his pattern.
You're sure about this two person thing?
Don't. Think Bailey.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
That's okay.
Hello? Ted?
What?
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Why don't you ask them?
Finish what my son started.
She dumped me.
No way.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
Go on, untie him.
Two.
He seemed harmless.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
And now, drum roll please...
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
Or it found us.
..and as lonely as I am...
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
What do you mean?
Sid, I'll come with you.
Don't do this.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
Oh, Sid, you’re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
Hello?
Do you want to die?
Shush.
What do you want?
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
What?!
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
Are you sure?
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
What do you mean?
What did you know about your mother?
How is that good news?
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Where's Gale?
They found another note?
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
And?
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Gale, your engine's still running.
What's your point?
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
What the hell are you doing?
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Yeah.
Gale he's got Dewey!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
I'm hanging up right now.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
WHERE?
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Close call.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
So...
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
You don't still think it was me?
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
Yes.
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
I don't know.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
Sure...
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
...please...
Come on, yes you do.
What's his name?
And why is that? Has something happened?
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Sidney's father?
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
Did you reach my Dad?
At the airport.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
Where is she?
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
I'll look for it.
Just stay back.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
And why is that?
So who are you?
Stu was with me last night.
For about two seconds.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
The why'd the police let him go?
The official term is "psychotic".
Do you believe this shit?
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
They think it's school-related?
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
I don't know...
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
Give it to me.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
It's none of my business anymore.
Yeah.
I heard.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
Good.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
Punishing.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Nothing.
I know.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
It is Victor.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
How do you know all about this?
We're focusing.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
That is.
What are you going to say?
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
Got a warrant?
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
Well, the reward still stands...
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
That's what I said.
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
But I just bought a good blanket.
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Why didn't he make his move back there?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
Not far from it...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
I got your boy killed.
She's not a little girl any more.
She'd be about thirteen now...
Stop that!
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
Cherry-red Tears.
What?
So do I, believe me.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
She was old.
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
What?
I've killed my husband!
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Tenth floor.
Ned…I know…I know
It's good.
What do you want, Kit?
How long has it been?
A woman of property?
Yes, I saw it.
When?
There's never any
So what do we do?
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
Where is the play?
Very well.
Who is she this time?!
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
Cut round him for now.
Wonderful, wonderful.
Burbage says you have a play.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
"Of love?"
Two hours at prayer!
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
I am not so well-born.
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Your Majesty.
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
"I know not."
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam…?
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Better fortune, boy.
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
Oh but why "alas?"
A lowly player.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
There is time. It is still dark.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh, do not go
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
You never spoke so well of him.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
Nor you for me.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
He is dead?
I . . .
Your aunt?
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
How do I offend, my lord?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
A theatre poet?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
I'm only asking what you think.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
You know what I'm talking about.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
I want to talk now.
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
There was a break-in.
Nothing.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Not at all.
Yeah?
Don't know what?
Yes, thanks.
Cameron.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
-- which is a hack.
You're right.
Have you seen Hugo?
Now?
Yes.
Love and happiness for ever.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
What?
You mean I can have the room?
What about?
Burglary?
did you hear anything before he cries?
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Of course.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Why do you want a room here?
What?
No one. I promise.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
It wasn't like that.
What do we do here, David?
Eh --
I'm not sure --
You get the job done.
That one, last week.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
No.
What?
Take all the time you like, doctor.
Same as everyone else.
Sorry?
What're you talking about, George?
Do you think George is a fairy?
Who?
That kid... the hairdresser.
Maybe... why do you ask?
That you were just indulging me.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
We cannot go into this later.
Yeah, I think so.
Gee, that's very serious...
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
I'll be back in a while.
I gotta talk to you.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
Whatever you say.
... what?...
... just, you could look very heavy...
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Then what do you think?
Right now?
How is she?
Wonderful woman.
Right.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You promised you'd do the show.
What!
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Well, what do you think?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
And?
George...
No! Don't! Please!
Look, either come in or stay out!
-- what guy?
-- we can't now.
I don't know what gets into me.
We're friends.
-- ass and legs --
Me?
What's wrong?
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
So I'm saying it...
What's that supposed to mean?
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- how did you get here?
-- yes, George.
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am?
Of course I like children.
Yeah.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Yeah, baby...
Could I talk to you for a second?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
When is that, George?
A friend dropped me off.
Ha, ha.
Well that's something.
-- and take this with you.
That's all you've got to say?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
-- A wash and set.
You need a cut.
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
You live like a pig.
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
I mean, how did that happen?
What took you so long?
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
Yes.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
I'd like a drink.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Jackie Shawn.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Who is that?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
But you have problems?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Well, you know what I mean.
Well, there was this one time --
Two weeks from tomorrow.
-- there's not much room --
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Thank you.
Do you have something against traveling?
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Yes?
Tony.
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Maybe he showed me something.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Room 237?
No I ain't.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Jack...
Yeah.
All right.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Do I have to?
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Well how can I repay you?
Yes, sir.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
No.
Who?
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Yes.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
I don't know.
As soon as possible.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
Stay away from me.
I'm gonna go now.
Well...
Not for me.
Right there.
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
But Uncle Al! You said-
But how?
He's... dreamy.  He's...
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
His ashes?
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
Oh my! 
What is it, Betty?
Look at that.  Get a gander.
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
It'll be hell.
Babies
A cigarette?
A novice.
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
What?
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Are you leaving us?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
You were unhappy?
What? 
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
And whom would you call?
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Sometimes it's not enough!
It never solves anything.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
What?
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
But... wait a minute...
You saved my life.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
And if I don't?
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
Really.
Joey?
She's gettin' away!
What's she doing?
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
It's better than ice cream.
An... entertainer?
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
We must be a curious sight to him.
You need to sleep.
All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Hmm?  See them?
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Chosen me?
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
What is the common thread between these victims?
Where are we going?
Thank you.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
Listen.
I hear nothing.
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
We should go.
Man or woman?
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
What was she doing?
This is farewell.
Lady Van Tassel...
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
You made this, and the drawings?
They have done nothing of the sort.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
It was not butchery.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
What did he say, Katrina?
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Let her go!
She has confessed.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
You got any money?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
Yeah.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
Don't tell me what to do.
Leave.
It went real good.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Stop it, Doyle!
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
What are all them books?
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
It was alive?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
You all right, Mama?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Yes sir.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Ma'am?
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
I've heard it said that way.
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
He just got out of the state hospital.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
Before they were married?
No! At least I don't think I am!
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
And your father? Is he from New York?
What happened?
What'll it be, Auggie?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
Uh, better make it one.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
No you're not.
It's all yours, baby.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
I almost got married once.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Open it.
What is this, some kind of joke?
And why the hell would you give me money?
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
And these?
Thanks for the tip.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
So what's the time?
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
I mean breakfast.
Of course. Where else?
The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Eight-thirty?
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
And?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
Come on, just a little hint.
The inspiration.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
You're implying th...
I can just feel my spirits soar.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
Robbed.  He was angry.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
I did.  Boy.
You said three minutes.
Cigarette?
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
What for, Sheriff?
You must think I like losing.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
And her farmhouse...?
Well...
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
Carl never lied.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Yes.  And that one, too.
Bye.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
What did he say?
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
You're right, Joe.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
You mean it's a girls' band?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
My name is Josephine.
Good night, Daphne.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
I'm engaged.
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Joe -
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
I'm a very sick girl.
I have a very low resistance.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
No!
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Personally, I'm Type O.
Why?
I'll throw up!
Who?
And I can never have children.
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
Anything today?
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
And you'll be in all evening?
Oh.
Afford it?
Really?
You know - I play tenor sax.
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
What's in Florida?
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Would you mind terribly?
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Why?
Who are you?
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
One of whom?
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
I seem to be out of gas.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Three?
What a beautiful fish.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
I don't mind if I do.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
They just sort of leave me cold.
That makes me feel just awful.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Oh, no!
Talk about sad.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
From a rich millionaire.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Go where?
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
I cut myself shaving.
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
I don’t think I can go through with this.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Don’t worry about it.
Hey.
I’m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don’t bake.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
What?
There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
Hey.
Crikey.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Bollocks, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
Mission accomplished.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
This happened to you?
Oh, no.
Don’t stop asking questions, okay?
It’s hard to explain.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
What?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Oh, no. He told you.
You want I nut him in the boat?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Dad!
I always wondered what happened with us.
What do you say to that?
You don't live around here, do you?
Is he here in Borderdale?
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
What's his name?
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
But where is my daddy!?
Yes, mam...
No, Miss Johnson...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
We didn't find Sounder yet.
Son, that was some trip you went on...
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
Sunday...
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
Yes, David...
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Yes mam...
Good night, Mama...
What's that you carryin'?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
My head hurts.
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
Suck my balls.
No you can't Kenny!
Goodnight, honey.
You've got a stupid accent too.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
The N word?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Donkey raping shit eater.
Mph rmph rm!
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Uhh... I don't know.
That's gonna take a long time!
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Oh, brother.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
You know I do.
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
I think we're moving.
Oh, thank you.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
You're certain of that?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Seen one like it before?
I don't know what we're facing.
Are you ready?
What's that?
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
Dawn.  Come in.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
You know, Elvis bowled.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
What do you think I can do?
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
No...
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
We ain't married no more.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
Don't tell me, John.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
Uh...over easy.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
Whoa.
Can I ask you something personal?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
What's plan B?
Sheila, please.
Do you talk with your mom?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
Where are you going?
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
What about plan C?
Tell your little pal to let go.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Open it, Captain!
Wait a minute --
Norman!
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
But she's --
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Thirty yards.
Don't do it, Norman!
Captain.
We're moving fast considering the storm.
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Then why am I here?
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Picked up something?  What is it?
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
When was this?
It's not sucking, sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
What?
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
What's the message?
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
To what?
What sub?
That's quite a secret.
You're next, Norman.
We have a library?
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What do you mean -- not normal?
What?  Why...
Beth --
Norman.
Beth --
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
I would.  But my suit --
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
You get it straightened out?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
We must've had it delivered then.
You think?
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Page 87.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
Manifested?
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
It's like a sleeping pill?
Where are you?
I'm feeling better.
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Someone did.
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
Yes.
Shut up, Beth --
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
Norman?  Where's Norman?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
Then what is it?
Is it coming from our own computer?
How are you feeling, Norman?
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
She's cracking, Norman.
I can't reach her.
You mean forget?
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Meaning?
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
What'd you say?
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
Norman Johnson.
You've heard of me?
You mean you don't know?
Who's everyone?
I don't see anything.
I don't know.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
I'll get the information.
Good morning!
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
What do you mean?
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
Are you all right?
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
This isn't going to work.
I think she's going to be all right.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
And you?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
See Threepio... do you copy?
I read you sir.
Are you safe?
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
They revoke our flight status.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
Carmen...?
I'm sorry, Carmen.
She's flying starships !
I don't want everyone to see.
None at all... We won.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
Shhhh...!
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
Cover me.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
Courage, I guess.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
The examination is a normal function.
They have repressed the Creator.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
Programming ready?
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
We're losing the pattern...!
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Well, it had sentimental value.
You quit.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
Yes.
I...
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
That's true.  You grow up here?
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
That: in an act of...
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Of course.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
Mmm.
What are you doing?  I love your script.
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
Cast stood me up.
What are you doing down there?
Gonna' be good as new.
Hi.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
But it's absurd.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
It used to be the Old Mill.
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
Gosh, you look nice.
What would you do with it, the printshop...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Ten thousand dollars.
That's so beautiful...
Where have you been...
I've been thinking.
I have to tell you something...
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
No.  Don't tell me that.
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
Mornin, sister.
I...
What...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Joe, the writer?
What's his name?
Who is it raped you?
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
But not that <u>way</u>...
This is Joe White.
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...I can't do it, Wally...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
I'm only trying to...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
Yes.
No.  No, but we're planning to.
A witness to what...?
He saw the accident...?
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
I can't.
I'm gonna nail it.
I have to tell the truth.
I didn't say anything to them.
What is that...?
That's what I said.
<u>Pay</u> her.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
He's got a gift for fiction.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Do something.
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
I've got two days to get this house...
I want them thrown in jail.
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
...the city council...
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
Where are we?
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Mass hysteria.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
How would you know sh...
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Like how?
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
I'm not.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
I'll miss you so much.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Hold lunch!
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
No.  I think it's ugly.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Then have a donut --
But you told us to starve.
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Rachel's job is she works.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
Yes.
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Before you.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
You say that like I don't know that.
And when did that pass?
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
You're WHERE?
Our children.
Called him.  We set an ap...
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
We don't have any coffee.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Yeh?
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Jackie?
Nobody likes a snoop.
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
See, I know that.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
My advice to you?  Don't die.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
You're the hip and fresh.
You'll learn.
We have to talk.
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
For what?
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
But?  But what?
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
It's just an assignment.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
What?
There are some rumors...
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Thank you.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Must've been hard being poor.
My baby.
My grandchild-baby.
How did they execute him?
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
What?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Come here, give me a hug!
Hello, Vi.
Uh huh.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Any books you like to read for fun?
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Hello?
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
Anything I might know about?
OK. Bye.
I know.
You a pervert?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
I'll lead.
Forget about it.
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
What happened?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
And what exactly do they intend to do?
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
What does that mean?
Can I have a glass of water?
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
You aren't sure!
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
Plan-R????
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
I don't think so, sir.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
Roger, maintain.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
War.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Just the missiles.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Release first safety.
How do you know he's dead?
What do you mean?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Like hell it does.
Sorry, King.
But I get a red light.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
That was really great.
No I quit.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
What?
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
You know what we should do? Go to the...
Fuck it!
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
No, no.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
She's dead?
No, no, no.
Ah, you know people there?
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Buff.
Yes! Free concert!
Whoa!
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Two-fifty? They go up?
He's drunk.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
What? What'd you do?
You lied to me.
Wow. You did that for me?
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
This is my home.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Jeff! Come up here!
Is that Bee-Bee?
Please?
God, I haven't seen you all day.
So you can give me more shit?
One!
It was a racial incident.
I would've stopped it.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
Oh, yeah?
Wait. What, what are you saying?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Like songs?
What do you mean?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, where's Erica?
Look, get down off my property.
Get off my roof!
Ready?
Yeah.
No, she was just sitting there?!
New York, huh?
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
I can't believe you're still here.
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah?
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
So where are you?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
Positive.
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.
Oh... What are you working on?
Shut up.
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
You want us to help you pick up?
Hello?
You sure you wanna go there?
Uh...maybe?
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
My what?
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
Hi, Artie.
That was the general idea.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
This is Miss Kramer.
Name dropper.
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
I didn't.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
I was afraid of that.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
Check.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
It's a good script, isn't it?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
I wouldn't know.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Fair enough.
They'll love it in Pomona.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
It's getting kind of late --
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
The other guests?
Keep it.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
Did she read the script?
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
Good.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
No you didn't.  You took the car.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
You heard him.  I'm a star!
Whose room was this?
How come?
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
Got a title?
Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
You know better than to interrupt me.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
I think I'd better keep it.
Home?
What do you want?
Is this Nigel's doing?
What's happening?
Let me kiss you.
No.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
But what if---it wasn't real?
Before you go...
Hey! Ethan!
Finished your estimate?
Oh no, not you again.
What an adorable hat.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
Did anybody notice you?
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Where is Earth?
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Your hair looks the same.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
That was meant for me!
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
Where is inner space?
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Then teach me how.
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
What are you talkin' about?
Not enough vodka in it.
It sure is.
I just can't stand this.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Call me.
He really was!
Well, aren't you excited?
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
Which country?
Columbia.
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
What?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Everything.
No, we're just going down.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
Who's the other woman?
What about you?
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
Thank ...you.
But the bridge...
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
Turn on the light.
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
She's not his mama either.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Oh Clark, no!
We'd better talk.
I'm listening.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
You're not selfish at all.
Lois, someday --
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
You do?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
What??
This way Lex.
Genius!  --  Lex.
Wrong.
Why didn't you go before we left?
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
My kind of people.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Oh! That black box in our cell?
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
Constantly.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Maybe I should sit this one out.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.
Superman? Has something happened to him?
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Awesome!
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
I think there's an angle.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
But he's never there.
What's that?
Where's Clark?
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
A toupee that flies?
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
The one Superman wrecked up?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
But . . . how could you beat him?
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Huh?
Oh.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
Shut up.
Krypton!
I read the article.
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
No news is not good news. Y'know
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
You got wax in your ears?
I mean the other one!
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
Gets you where you live, huh?
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Who...who...
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
What color underwear am I wearing?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
But you said...
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Have you been waiting long?
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
From what?
From what?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
That's what he said, is it?
What do you think?
We've only got honey.
From you?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
What's vermin again?
Yes.
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
I won't lie.
Yes.
Perfect.
Here we go.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
Who are you?
Who did they get for that?
Any criminal record?
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
Yes.
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
And where did you sit that morning?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
You are?
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
I was scared.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
You saw the speedometer?
Pretty slick, eh?
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
No.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
Did she accept?
See my mother?
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
You print them, don't you?
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
You're sure.  Find out for me.
Avidly.  He was staring.
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
Don't you know who that man is?
What sort of thing?
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
Do you know about the chip?
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Why?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
Why do you cry?
Alriight!!  My man!
Remember what I said, you can't...
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
We're better off by ourselves.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I love you.  I always will.
You look like handmade shit.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
I have detailed files.
The CPU from the first terminator.
I must be destroyed.
It's finally over.
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
I guess you admire musicians.
Some.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
Yes.
So what is it?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Colonel. Pleasure.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
I have a duty.
I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
May I ask a question?
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Tough, tough!
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
I have no idea what you're talking about.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
I don't understand what you mean.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Show you?
He did?
Who's he?
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
So, you never heard of him.
Nope.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
Great.
What's it to ya?
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
About what?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
What's that?
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
I want it to be over for you.
That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
And who was the enemy?
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Why were the other two women killed?
Give me the short version.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
What <u>is</u> your problem?
A game?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
There's got to be a flashlight.
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
No.
I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
What's C.R.S.?
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Get out.
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
Get us out of here...
Nicholas...
Where'd you get that... ?
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
No.
This isn't an escort service?
Like a stroke?
How do you mean, exactly?
It's them.  They did this.
Do you know how to change a tire?
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Really?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
No, thank you.
A game?
What kind of vacation?
Physical?
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
It was a different floor then...
Guess!
I need the police.
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Why are you following me?
I wasn't expecting you.
What's happened...
Nicholas...
You're joking.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Sure.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
You used the wrong test.
Nell!
It's still an electric shock!
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
Like she smelled it too?
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I don't know.
Come on.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
What do you want?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Why?
Yes.
What did it cost?
Not really.
Yes.  I've missed it.
David?
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
We think someone is here.
We think?
Where do we go?
You should have let me do the talking.
Man knows what he likes.
Boomerang.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
That was one of them?
What are we standing on?
Well, those are the breaks.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Here, are you always this sarky?
Weren't you on a television series?
Now who's being sarcastic?
Not embarrassed.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
When did you get in?
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Are you serious.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Get seven years, did you?
You ever been to London?
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Hey.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
You've made it ... brighter.
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
What.
Tell me.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
Geez, Mr Crane.
...I stank, didn't I?
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
Uh-huh.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
Cash.
Sure.
...Were you in the service, Ed?
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
How much to they want, Dave?
...Oh, Jesus.
...Dave?
You don't have to--
Honey...
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
No thanks.
I'm fine.
He a good man?
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
Yeah.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Huh?
OK.
...Nah.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
Yeah--
He's a barber.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Uh... you're under arrest.
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
Behind you.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
So the method of death is the only connection?
If you don't mind, this could be important.
Apparently it's huge.
This place is a maze.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Dr. Green has to see you!
It's still back there!
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
What are we talking about here?
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
What's going on?
How many storage areas are there?
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Argo!  Hobbes!
Oh... my... God!
Oh no.  I smell it.
Mbwun.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
How does it work?
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't understand.
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
You're not.  Where is it?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
Hide quickly!
I think... it means it's full.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
You want to book the flight?
Cue music...
He doesn't care.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Who are you?
The memory of who?
Yeah, what happened?
I think I'm mixed up in something.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
I told you I can't.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Stay where you are!
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Truman, what about that sign?
How are you, Mother?
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
You got it.
Is there any way around?
The whole area's being evacuated.
There's no one here.
I don't understand.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
This man's still alive.
How can this be?
Incinerate it. Like the others.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
Do I know you?
You a reporter?
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
Negotiating with whom?
I'm not sure. A virus --
Jesus, Mulder...
No.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
All the equipment is brand new.
Where would they be going?
What do you think it is?
Very weird.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
Just like that --
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
Agent Mulder --
How deep does this go?
Where's Scully?
About the conspiracy?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Damn him.
I don't need them anymore...
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Peter, okay?
With Stargher I saw things...
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Then what is he?
He's mine?
Mocky-Lock.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Intravenous administration complete.
What's wrong?
When did he lapse into the coma?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Thank you.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Drink?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
In German?
Tell me about him.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
I thought you wanted...
What are you going to do?
I'm going back home.
...you know.
...Headquarters.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
His.
Why are you lying?
Of course.
...parents.
Do you know this man?
He works in a military hospital.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
You can help us.
That's what we want to find out.
I don't know.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Just around the corner.
How will I know you?
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
I can't say that I have.
Ever seen one?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Well?...
I see.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
Win what?
What time is it?
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
You've got plenty of contacts.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?
...the best way one can, you know.
The Roumanian?
Vinkel.
Find out?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
What else did he tell you?
...this time.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
But he has been there, off course.
Have you told someone?
Too far?
What, do you like it here?
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Is he a Nazi?
Who's Linda?
When can I see you?
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
No.
What do you care?
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Who's Eichmann?
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
Is it okay if I record this?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
And Jewish men like to get it.
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
So you're saying it's not true.
Give me a reason not to.
Explain it so I can.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
You're lying.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
I've got to get back to the --
Mrs. Moebius.
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
You missed on purpose.
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
Where do you think you're going?
So what?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
But your man isn't quite a God!
You're leaving?
Did you tell him?
No!
It can't be true!
The Italian, I presume?
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
This is a great pleasure.
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
What was he like, when he was little?
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
He can learn.  He is learning.
... Not yet.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
The medics are looking all over for you.
Is he here?
The rules are the rules.
Noireuter.
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
What?
No.
Why?
... I was right about what?
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
... No?
How do you know that?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
You sure?
You'll try again tomorrow?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Why?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
How was your trip?
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Will he understand Spanish?
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
We do!
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
You two know each other?
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Cool. What's it do?
What are you doing?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
What about me?
I don't know.
You really think so, Charlie?
Sure, I like my leopards
What do you want to see him for?
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
See you tomorrow —-
Well, I'd best be off.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Yes?
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
I don't know.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
What do you do now?
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
That's a fact, isn't it?
On his back, I suppose.
And I never will- you know what's between us — we're a thing But this is serious competition.
On his back, I suppose.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
And she waited here for him?
Maybe I want to feel badly.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
I’m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
What... What are you talking about?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Mr Lombard?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing don’t learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn’t suit you! Who knew I’d found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, who’d want to make sure it didn’t fall into the wrong hands?
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
...You-you spoke to him?
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it’s never that complicated really.
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
You wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
Hah... What about Nathalie?
What am I to do with the packages if...
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Then find another way.
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
What sort have you got?
Yes... Good, good...
Tomorrow?
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Where is the Austrian?
...On holiday?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Where are the kids?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
Good.
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
Hello, Jane. It’s me.
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
Any friends?
What happens now?
Anything at all?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
Is this Friedman?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
What is it?
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...
I can’t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What’s your sister’s number?
I’m sorry. It’s just you don’t look local...
Er... Yes...
Los Angeles is 100 miles away.
No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
Would you know where I might reach her?
What’s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Cinq cents.
Où est passé ton salon?
Then why don’t you reach him?
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn’t need your confession...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
What's going on?!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Yes...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
I'm staying, Jean.
No...
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Yes, probably... maybe...
No, I... I held it up to...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Where... where am I?
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
Were you baptized?
What did it tell you?
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
... You look wonderful...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Supposing she's an assassin?
Your majesty, I really think you...
... as always, majesty...
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
The wind will be against us...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
Damn right!
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
This is no good!
Clear?
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
I... submit to Our Lord.
Did your voice tell you to jump?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Besides, what about these...?
Yeah...
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
How many did he give you?
I don't know... I thought...
Yes!
They're going to come and visit you in here?
They won't come anyway.
God asked you to do something?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
What are you doing on the wall?
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Is that bad?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Someone you know?
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Wladek, please.
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
How long have you been married?
Let me see this.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
What's this about?
Mama, that was a great dinner.
I can look after myself!
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
Yes, but what good did it do?
Jehuda, give me something to do.
Can you help? I've no money...
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Wladek! How are you?
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Pig!
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
Where are you hiding?
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
To be deaf?
Like it were a piano?
Ohhh I've never been there. 
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
You'd have to organise it up here.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
No, words. You have never heard words?
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
Oh no, it can't come now.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
You've missed this bit.
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
Do I know any gigs?
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
I like griftin'.
I'm busy, Floyd.
Which one?
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
Everything go all right?
What do ya mean?
He threatened to kill me.
It was too noisy.
Yeh.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
I'm not sure I know it.
See and raise five.
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
I don't even know you.
All right, when?
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
You're a lucky man, all right.
You stayin' in or not?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
You weren't hired to miss him.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Cheer up, darling.
She's got me worrying, too.
Well!
Oh, Andy.
Do you think I care
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I didn't.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
How did you ever remember me?
You heard about Julia Wolf?
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
Not without a warrant.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
You mean that body-----?
Oh, then you did hear from him?
There are a few things we want to check up on.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
Oh, he's sitting up.
No.
But what if you need more money?
I see.  I see.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Why do you say that?
Hello, baby.
I had him out this morning.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
What are you drinking?
She didn't tell me a thing.
No.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
You're a fine watch dog.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
I never saw that before.
Who gave it to you?
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
Yes.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
You mean, he might be hiding there?
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
It's the only way it makes sense.
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
I know I left them there.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Home?
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
A casual one.
They stopped.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
You ready?
What about it?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
You're the one with all the ideas.
Maybe I do.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
He's an enemy soldier.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
Just keep quiet.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
What!?  What!?
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
Oh, that's fun.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
It's a mine, isn't it?
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
My leg is falling asleep.
How's this going to work?
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
It's a fire fight.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
Stay low.
A whole lot of nothing.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
How!?
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
Epps?
I don't want to die.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
Oh, God...
Shi'ites, I think.
...Wes...?
But...
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Yeah.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
What?
Australia.
People are suffering.
Yeah, you're funny.
You will.  You'll get it.
You really think there's a treasure inside?
Yeah.  So?
Like I said; so?
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Oh, God!
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
I can't hear him.
Correct.  Origin?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Hurry up.
I'm not hungry.
When?
Now.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
I've never been under the table before.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
What?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
What's going on?
You're in violation.
...and you're not lost now?
Maternity ward, huhh!
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
Soon he'll be a plastic cube.
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
Where are they?
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Go ahead.
Aren't you on suspension?
What're you talking about?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
What's up?
What's wrong?
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
Alex-
Alex, please.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
He is!
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
How're you guys doing?
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
Reilly, Vice. I-
So what're we looking for?
What?
Goddamit, Reilly--
Sir...
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
And it had diamonds in the back.
Yes.
Yes.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
Eleven o'clock! 
<u>Niente!</u>
You've never been in Constantinople?
Good morning, Major.
You're looking fine, Major.
Nice suit.
Just dull.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
I hope you find the figures correct.
But not now.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
I know it!
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
Monescu!
Seven and nine!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
What?
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Spanish passports?
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
What time is your rendezvous?
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
But, Lily--
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
I know that niche.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
That's what you need!
Do you know my first name?
Yes!
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Oh? 
How do you like my dress?
Marvelous.
Crimson!
Like that?
So you think you can get me?
But attractive--
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
But it could have been glorious.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
I think you'd better go.
I beg your pardon!
Your bag?
No--I'm sorry.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
You're certain?
Rush her.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
The partners want to know how it's going?
She's not on the starboard side either.
I make my own luck.
An accident?!
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Sure. Count me in.
This should be amusing.
The boats are all going.
How cold?
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Well, here you are.
So don't marry him.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
I know, I know.
I'm so cold.
I can't feel my body.
April 14, 1912.
Don't come any closer.
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
How'd you ever get away with it?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
This is Miss Marsh.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
--and I can tell you where to get off.
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Guess again, copper.
How about a little game later?
Like her paint job?
Never eat before the show.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
Thanks.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
But--
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
What, again?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
What?--
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Lose?--I won a little--
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
Where do you live?
Well, did you find me?
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Who won?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Like it?
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
What do you mean?
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Thank you.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
I'm all right.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Where'd you get that horse?
Beauty, ain't he?
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
You retired, too?
On three?  You call it.
You don't even know him.
Very cosmopolitan.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Awful lot of money.
That was lovely!
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
I hate Sadie.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
I forgave you the moment you said it.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.
- Instant melt-down.
I'm sorry.
Where can I find him?
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
Natalya?
Where to now, Jimbo?
Interesting video tape.
... Does this do anything?
Bourbon. Neat.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Boyfriend?
- Shut up!
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
Blood or Dutch?
This has got to be a mistake.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
And number two?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
Of course.
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
Sabotage?
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
What's wrong?
What the hell is going on?
Maybe. Maybe not.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
Why don't you come in for a while?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Do you think you won?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
What for?
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
Good morning.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
You should go back and rest.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
Woody!  Buzz!
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Yes, I can.
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Shhhhhhh!
What?!
Something's screwy here.
I don't know!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Laser-envy.
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
No!  No, no, no, no!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
I got it, Woody!
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Woody!  Speed up!
He's a pyjama case, really.
I did like the music.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
He made that. In his off hours.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
Go away.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
You're not so old yourself!
Stop it!
So had I.
We're too young.
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
I... I don't really know.
He's not here.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
Carl, that's insane.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
Why?
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
So's the video camera.
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Helena --
You can't make me.
Live with your parents?
I get A's.  All A's.
What is this, like freebase?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
What do you think she wants?
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
A place we have, that we know is protected.
I'm aware of that.
It's possible.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
She's not at that place you sent her?
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
Yes, I hope so as well.
Hello.
Who do we interface with on their side?
What kind of research?
Bit fucking late, like.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
Shag her senseless.
You've stabbed me, man.
Twenty thousand.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Come on.
Easy for you to say.
Is that a promise, then?
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
It's no problem.
Following the game at all?
I'm sorry, Tommy.
No, I'm clean.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Why?
The Sick Boy method.
It's the great outdoors.
A walk.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
No, no, it's not possible.
The ship....
Rescued at last.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Oh, God
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Yes, Captain.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
There, you see? See?
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
Spock.
Spock?
Who are you?
I trust your message was received?
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
No special conditions?
Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
I don't understand...
Sybok.
Dillinger?
Did he say why?
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Come on in...
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
That was uncalled-for.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Where did you hear that name?
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
Why? What are you going to do?
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
A User?
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
You think we can make it there?
Do you know what he's talking about?
Yori... hey...
You've grown, big program.
Nice...
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
Where are you going?
I'm done.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
She could be telling the truth.
Any minute now.
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Yes what?
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
They said you had to run out.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
Yes.
What?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Did you pork her Harry?
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
As much as you used to?
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Get going! 
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
To our assignment.
What is it you need me to do?
How?
Let me speak to Clarence.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Is that your real name? Really?
I took a cab.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
Ask me them again. One by one.
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
You're a whore?
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
Who and what is a Drexl?
Uh-huh.
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
I do.
What?
Why?
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Clarence sent a letter?
You goin' out?
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Where?
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
In case of what?
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
Don't you?
No. No you're not.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
We grew up together.
Do you still have friends on the force?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
Where'd he come from?
Or a bit player -
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Naw, he ain't home right now.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Yes.
Do you know where we can find him?
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
We want you to tell us about last night.
Well?
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
So that...???
I need to go now.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Change what?
You wouldn't understand.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
You're afraid of germs?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
"Never cry wolf!"
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
Clues?  What kind of clues?
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
They're keeping an eye on me.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
Are you hurt?
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
What's the matter with your leg?
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
You want me to rob him?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
What....???
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Uh, that message...me?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
You have him in restraints.
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
I think I've heard that before.
You don't fear death?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Where to?
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Twenty-after-ten.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Open up!
Let me have a Beck's.
Kirin?
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
I think I burned my gun hand!
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
What's the matter?
What does it look like?
Jesus.
You're welcome, Grace.
You're not from around here, are you?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Least you can leave.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
A medicine man?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Like you.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You just walk away.
I can't.
How much money has he got?
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
What about us?
What was I supposed to do?
Where's the safe?
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Let's go in the bedroom.
To get my car.
You heard me.  Count it out.
He was going to take the money.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Well, nothing.
Where the hell am I going to go?
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Hey!
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
I was hoping we could talk.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You meant it.
Make it twenty.
The time wasn't right.
You know what I mean.
Trouble with the car again?
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
You came to take my wife from me?
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
Kids.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
I think I've heard that before.
What do you want for free?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Mister!
Now, what's this?
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
I was hoping we could talk.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
And what does that make you?
How much could you get?
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
It's not what you think, Jake.
It's the truth, Jake.
Come on, Jake --
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
But he's dead.
So?
Yeah, I can fix it.
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
You've been there?
Two-hundred.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Darrell.
That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
I don't know your real name.
No, I've got it.
What happened to your hand?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
I guess it must.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
What's the matter?...Grace?
Nothing.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I wanted to talk.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
Harlin's.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Who was that on the phone?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
They look nice.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
...I think rust.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
In college. A car accident.
I assumed because of the train.
Like what?
Quick.
Are you finished?
What's he look like?
All of it.
I'm not scared.
Not really.
No.
Did you get up from your seat?
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.
I fined 'em instead.
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
He didn't say nothin', huh?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Nope.
I thought... you was an angel.
Three days. Are you hungry?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Are you really going to kill them?
Free ones?
She back in Kansas?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
But... if he doesn't miss?
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Huh?
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
You... gonna take... the money?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
Sally?
You ain't like that no more.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
That fella come by... Tom.
See that scrub oak yonder?
Say, Ned... ?
Yeah.
I don't get it.
Who ?
They just said they wanted time.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
What the hell do you want?
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
Tough break.
No killing?
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
How are you, Keaton?
Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
Who is he?
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
That was all Fenster and McManus.
You got him wrong.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
I don't.
But Keaton...
I never heard of him.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
Edie.
This is all bullshit.
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
Why lie about everything else, then?
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
We thought it was just.
And no one will know the truth.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
Yes.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Tell me one?
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...We did everything we could...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Neurology?
How is that?
Huh!
Mr. Concannon...?
No further questions.
I...yes.
I...
You've just said you signed it.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
... that's all right.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
Dr. Gruber ...
... and you're going to do that?
Yes.
Her doctors killed her.
) I'm sorry ...?
The most respected ...
Why is that?
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Listen to me, fella...
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
From the magazine?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Yes.  Price...
I'm a lawyer.
What...?
I...
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You, you don't under...
No...no...
I have to talk to you.
Hi, Mickey ...
... now who is that ...?
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
So what?
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
What happened, Joey...?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
...yeah...good...
...four years ago...
... You saw her?
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
... fifty thousand dollars?
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
She told me.
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yeah.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
How often does this happen?
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
You won't have to.
Judy Barton.
But you haven't lived here long.
Will you have dinner with me?
Mmm.
Tomorrow night? Well --
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
No.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
Scottie, what are you doing?
That's what I had in mind.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
How does it work?
Scottie, why are we here?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
You can't. You're afraid!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
Some money.
Where were you?
Oh... wandering about.
Wandering about.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Some people prefer it.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
Why?
Take me away from here?
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
What else?
Yes?! But --
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Oh, yes!
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I know. Everybody tells me.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Sorry, old man. Work.
How?
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Step number two.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Pop Leibel.
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Yeah.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
What I've been doing?
By whom?
She died.
But you said grey, sir.
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
What?
You're an asshole Adam.
Name one.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
You're not a team player.
Don't even start.
What are you talking about?
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
What about the blood?
We've already done this.
So that's what we're doing.
You got us into this mess.
What is your problem?
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
They're driving me nuts!
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
What is it?
Who?
That's right.
He just had two.
We need padded chairs.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
What kind of words?
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
That's right.
Isn't it a little late?
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
The hell I did!
Take Mexico.
They need leadership.
The wedding cake check?
You forgot the tent?
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
Who else?
He's weird.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
With all my heart.
I'm not. What's the problem?
Go down where?
Of course.
Just a bit of organizing.
What okay?
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
I know.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Yeah. You.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Micheal, by accident.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
He kept saying he was protected.
The only proof is those bodies.
It means she's insecure.
You're not breathing right?
I don't care for him.
Where did you get that?
Buzzing?
I don't hear it.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
The first day.
Did she believe you?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
My God...
Okay great. What will that be?
I'll come to you tonight.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
Is it all right?
Yes.
That's fifteen by seven?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
Me?
My God, what have you done to him!
Why the bad temper?
So, Ramona!
If you wake first, wake me up.
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know, sir.
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
What about you, Manuel?
How do you feel?
Have I slept long?
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
You think he's smart?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
What the hell happened?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
Get that fucking thing away from me!
Coordinated by polymer neural net.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
You ready for this?
What are you doing?
Who said that?
She's beautiful, you know?
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Relax. I know what you meant.
Don't get out of the car.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Parker -— stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you——
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
You're not capable of it.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Find out anything?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
What can it hurt.
...and...
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
Naa, fuck this, this is nothing.  Oh, Lord -- this just got <u>Big</u>.  I see it -- <u>Big</u> -- Big for <u>you</u> and big for <u>me</u>.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
...that's the general idea.
...they sound what?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
We'll be back tonight.
Why is this putz on the air...
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Anything at the Airport?
<u>Nashville</u>...?
What about him?
Stanley, you can't do this....
Oh, MiGod.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
...where is my pill?
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
What's on your mind?
Why do they go to War?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
How much...?
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Who?
"The Country Is At War." 
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
...we get our hands on him?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Big mistake.
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
He's supposed to be flying in from Europe.
Why not?
They'll be here in ten minutes.
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
Deal's changed.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
See y'at the Finish Line.
They look stupid.
Shoes, Hats....
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
You like it?
Oh huh...
I'm just talking about the Hats.
The hats.
Why a beret?
...you're gonna Punch in a Kitten Later.
This is <u>nothing</u>,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a <u>pharmacist</u>, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...
He's not dead, Ronnie.  He's just a little understandab1y, <u>fatigued</u>.  Let's get him to some help...
a "pond," or
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
All right, I owe you one Marv.
What's going on?
Start unloading.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
The FAA announcement.
What brings you out here...
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.
Another cup of coffee?
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
Okay.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Oh no, no...
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
How do you know?
...Gordon.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
...isn't it perfect!
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Why?
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Hmm.
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Sell my soul?
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
He loves you very much.  He just--
Did you?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Are you humoring me?
How?
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
Who are you?
You're the flower lady.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
This fence...it's so...
You do?
Love.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
Stop.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Oh...
It's alright.
Did I?
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
But Claire--
If she was dangerous before--
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Claire?
It's okay if you're not.
You are...
It's just us now.
Maybe we should just...
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
Mmnph.
Oh.
Claire?
Did you call the police?
You are so brilliant.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
You're kidding.
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Did you call about the Feurs?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
I didn't do that.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
What are you doing?
You're not at the center.
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
This is the Feur thing?
We walked all night...
But I don't remember.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
Not personally.
What's the matter?
Who?
I never asked you to quit!
What?
What's that for?
You don't have to do that.
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
Then what is he...?
Two what...?
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
A what...?
Nothing was ever more false.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
Eighty million doll --- ?
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
She didn't feel them
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
It is from love.
To love, you must be able to feel.
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
But I could understand. I want to understand!
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
What do you see...?
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
Harder...
And whose houses do you design...?
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Rowan...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Hello..
I don't think of us that way - ever.
That's cause we're below sea level.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
You alright...?
A bit much.    Lucas.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
I can't.
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
You okay...?
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
It doesn't mention 'females only'
I don't know
I don't know
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
What?
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Yes...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
Why did you let him in?
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
Someday, I'll find out.
That's crazy talk.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
What is it now?
Dead?
Which you pulled, hard!
Dad, please.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
The lesson being?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
Finally, some gratitude.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
You want it in writing?
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Are they okay?
I meant biologically.
Great.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
Your article sucked.
In what sense?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Where are we going?
I'm very aural.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Well? Surprised?
You promise you'll finish school?
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
You do like girls, don't you?
You were the new and improved you.
You think we should be more open minded?
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
You look pretty.
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
What about the blood?
She still work there?
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
It's our job, Gloria.
You're telling me you believe the guy?
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
You could say that.
Where's this coming from?
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
Yeah... okay... he did
Ms. Toller?
I said he did.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Okay, what's the matter?
What?
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Where, the mall?
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Kelly...
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
That's not your line.
There's nothing for them to get.
I just want my life back...
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Get away from me.
Yes.
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
Sam...
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
J. S. Bach.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Starting with a screw?
Limestone quarry?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
All what?
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
What way is that?
Thank you.
What's this?
This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
Anyone?
You've... done... this... before.
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Nicely said, sir.
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Thank you, friend.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Are you a warrior?
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
You!!
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Who?
You?
She's a bird, Willow.
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
What do you want!
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
What's the magician's weapon?
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Time is running out.
Are you sure?
I'm getting her out of there!
Talk!  Say something!
Obviously.
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Your hole is healed, then?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
You know who?
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde – what's-her-name – come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Just us.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Where are you taking us?
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
I can't.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
Two days.
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Hochmut?
I know what he said.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Where's my baggy pants?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Wrong.
I admit I don't know where he is.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
That has no place in this house.
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
She say where he is?
Aunt Em!
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
This?
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
I thought you said she was dead.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
No, they won't - honestly.
Did you say something?
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
And him a brain.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
...yes.
A home --
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Oh, come on.
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
...don't talk.
Ohhhh --
...free!
Um-hmm.
Where's Kansas?
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Oh -- Oh --
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
Oh, you did it yourself!
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
That's right.
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
No, you don't.
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
Well --
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
They won’t get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
The plutonium is missing.  They’ve taken the core!
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
The King pipeline.
Construction’s not exactly my line.
I’ve scheduled a medical for you.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Who?
The report King bought. It’s a manual. Renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
The inside man?
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Beautiful, isn’t it?
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
What is it?
What’s wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
All this, because you fell for Renard?
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
Was this all about the oil?
See?  You’re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn’t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Wrong answers?
A whore fucking.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Because --
What -- am I --
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
No.  I just wanted you to --
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
They're practically on us . . .
That's because --
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Where's Laurie?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
We should get back --  What?
No comment.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
What about you?
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
What is this place?
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
I don't know what you're talking about.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
Aren't you afraid?
Yorgi and Kirill.
Where's he headed?
What are you doing?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
Alright, so I'll get more.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
You're serious?
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
What's the deal?
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
What's "Anarchy 99"?
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
I wish I could go.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
By reading my thoughts?
Dr. Grey.
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
I do love a good check mate.
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
Where are we going?
You designed this yourself?
Don't you knock?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
You have the wrong house.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
No!
What was your grandfather's name?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
Surprised?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
Love me?
Darling!?!
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
I don't know what you mean, sir.
This is the only library I know of.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
My father was a sick man.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Fro-derick!
Did you hear that strange music?
Could be worse!
Do you have the name I wrote down?
You'll be getting me sad next.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
No, no!  That whole thing!
Yes, Master!
How do you know it was a 'she'?
Thanks...for all your help.
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
There's only one way.
Come on, big fellow!
Is everything ready?
May I see your violin?
Did you have a pleasant trip?
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Well...
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Look, Doctor!
Me?  Sing?
All right -- give it to him!
I think so.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
Yes, sir, name, please?
Foooooood!
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Which one?
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.

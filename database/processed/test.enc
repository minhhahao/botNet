You got something on your mind?
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Hi.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
Why didn't you tell me?
That's not
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I just wanted --
Patrick -- is that- a.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Why?
The prom?  Kat has a date?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
A hundred bucks a date.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
Who's that?
You didn't
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Have you seen him?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You know who The Raincoats are?
Okay?
Why?
And I'm in control of it.
Do what?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
You 're so --
Wholesome.
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Fallacy.
No what?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
My grandmother's .
Was that your sister?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Right.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
They took everything...
May I ask by whom?
My letters of appointment.
What are you listening to?
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
What do you see?
Chief says -- how many?
Chief says...
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
I have to disagree.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
What do you read?
He must be replaced.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
...delusions and paranoia.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Now I become custody of police department?
What about back home?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Oh.
It was my decision, not his.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Who do you think, Chief?!
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Where is she?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Describe him.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This isn't homicide school.
You goin' to the escort service?
Two heads.
I'm on duty.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
You wanna talk to her alone?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
What do you want?
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Could be Leon's.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
How much money are you carrying with you?
In here, says he wants a million.
Whore?
What is it?
I'm serious.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
We started over, you can too.
Viewer discretion advised!
He's my collar!
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
Yeah?
Get outta here!
What the hell happened?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
CONTINUED
Sure, what is it?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Yes.
How?
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
I'm having a party tomorrow.
One, two, three. Can I speak to Mommy?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Are you quite sure?
Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I never paid for it in my life.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Here you go, baby.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
You made that move, huh?
Must be billy's girl.
Just tell me about the money.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
Where's luther?
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Which one pulled the trigger?
What a screw-up.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You're hopeless.
I'm all wet.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Hi, it's me...
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
You real down?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
You're impossible...
Hey, two days with him is enough.
How about some ammo?
Five bills.
Corn-i-Lius?
You noticed...
They all like this in your family, father?
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
Uh... at least fifty.
So, just how big was this fare?
Have you pulled yourself together?
...Ma???
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
He's on vacation.
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
What did you say? What did you do?
And the third one?
Why not?
Three of us will never fit in there!
You hear that?
Apipoulai!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You get that off the screen?
I want to sleep... forever...
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
The cash man!
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Recommendations.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
How's the detective business?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
I don't know what to say
Don't...
Mrs. Christian.
What you see is what I got, mister.
What are you talking about?
And they are?
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
You brought the money?
Is that him?
I figured you share information.
Celebrity Films.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
What the fuck are you.. ?
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't ask questions.
I told you, I don't know.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Give me the film.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
How much?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
... Hello... ?
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
Where does he sell it?
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Who is he?
He's odd.
Pittsburgh?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
I told you I can't, not yet.
I hope it's nothing serious.
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
I don't know.
Why do you think he did it?
It got to be too much for him.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
Will you let me look?
No...
Do you know what happened to her?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
None too discreet, is he?
No, sir, he is not.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
What?
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
How long have you been awake?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
I don't get it.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
What?
I'll tell you later.
She doesn't want me around
Hi, beautiful.
Had kind of a long night.
Krueger is reality.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
He sure loves to stay awake.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
Yeah...
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
You, too?
How is he - ?
What is it?
My father!  He's not - ?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
But if they <u>do</u>?
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
Somewhere down there?
Is there any way out of it?
What about down?
Excuse me, Skipper---
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
You're sure it's Cyclops?
What's the running time?
Right <u>at</u> him?
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
He's on to us!
You think so.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
They said.
Hmm.
Safety on?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
In the chest.
On your sleeve.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
I'm fucking out of here.
Lawford?
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
You know.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
No what?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yes.
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Are we going in this?
It's pretty old.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
I know.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
I won't. You interested?
Maybe.
We should talk.
No problem. Look, I...
You okay?
You okay?
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
What happened?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
Who are you?
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
You talked to Jack?
You remember Margie Fogg?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Everything you know is from me.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Crawl!
Rolfe.
There was something. It happened up your way.
Well, it was an accident.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Not particularly.
Yeah.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
You read my mind.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
I prefered the terrorists.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
How?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
Do you have to be so brutal?
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Stop.
Flying the plane.
This is the President.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
You wanna knock of f?
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Did you feel that?
Oveur.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
Ted, we're taking off!
Elaine.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Ted!
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
You mean...
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
You're sure?
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
You folks need any help?
Yes.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Do you want to talk about it.
Thank you. Cream?
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
No. I'm all alone.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Surely you can't be serious.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
George Zipp said that?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
That's right.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
What did he have?
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
No. No one that I know of.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
You got a telegram from head�quarters today.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Good-bye, darling.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
You are Cassandra?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Lay off, asshole.
Here?
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Nothing?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
How the hell do you know that?
Tell me.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
I believe he is probably lying.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Well, let's roll, George.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.

What?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
Movement!
What?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
You did okay, Bishop.
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
You son of a bitch.
Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes.  Set up for life.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
One of us?
...We're coming in.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Fuck you.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
You promise?
I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze.
I'm sorry, Newt.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
I knew you'd come.
Can we dream?
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Why won't you check out LV-426?
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Yes.
Why not?
Where?
Oh!
A Turkish brothel.
What?
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Don't bother.
Why what, sir?
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
What is it?
Where?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
No!
What?
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
I'm not telling you.
Why not?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Then he didn't send you?
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
How much will you pay him?
Am I interrupting something?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
He's adorable!
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
It's just a trifle, of course.
A-flat, Majesty.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
And the result satisfies.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Yes, what about him?
Why are you here?
Am I not welcome?
Do you always live like this?
Don't you have a maid?
Yes.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Papa, is this your idea?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Not that I've seen.
I don't know. He has pains.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Opera? Opera!
Yes?
Sssh!
What did he say? What did he say?
Well?
German!
Leave that alone!
Yes.
Can I see it?
Why not?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Madame.
Mio caro Adone.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
Really? Why?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
You burned the score?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Who are you?
You mean she's not coming back?
Finish what?
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
You go fast!
Do you have it?
Do you want to rest a bit?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
What do you want?
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Where?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
I did.
Yes?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
I can't wait.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
The American? Yes, duck.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
No, why?
Could you get here without any trouble?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
Call me Alex.
Shall I read to you?
That's easy enough.
Will you come with me?
What?
Alex?
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Now see here young man.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
It's a five-pointed star.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
What do you think was wrong?
I don't know. Come on.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
I'm going completely crazy.
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
It's you, David.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
No, thank you, Doctor.
He's on the telephone.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
We've been waiting fifteen minutes�
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
What is?
Doesn't that come next?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Why, Matt!
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Why pick on him ?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
What time did this thing happen?
My wife? What's she got to do with you?
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Yes, sir.
Why?
No.
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Yes, why?
What did you find out, Mike?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
It couldn't have been earlier?
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
You have no shame.
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
What?
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Where you boys going?
What are you saying?
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Where'd you get all these riders?
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
You're right, sir.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
What the --
Boys...
What do you think?
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
Bob's upset.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
Did you kill Yankees?
Sparkling rocks?
Hmm.
Let me see that.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
But I like the presidential suite.
That's what I would have done.
You cocky little bastard.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
I can't believe this.
What the hell is that sound?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Pull out.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Get married. Have a wedding.
We should do it.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
I think you should go now.
Don't come back.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Leaving what?
Late?
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Patrick?
Anywhere you want?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Who's Ted Bundy?
What's that?
Jean? What?
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Patrick? Is that you?
Jean-I'm not-
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
What are I doing?
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Do you feel that way?
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Hmmm.
Oh.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Have you consulted a psychic?
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
And?
I'm hungry.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
No, Owen.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
He's your boss. He's not your --
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
They hack into people's programs?
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
My goodness.
You're living here?
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
Gary?
You do?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
You know my name.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Why would you do a thing like --
Hmm?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
How close are you?
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Why were you so careless?
Thank God.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
That's lame, isn't it?
It's three years old, it --
Jesus, Teddy.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
May I wash you?
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
We won, Austin.
When do I begin?
Oh, and Austin...
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
That does not compute.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Sure.
Let's go get him!
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Watch out, you're on my hair!
Sorry. Move your hand to the left. There you go. Gorgeous.
I am not.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
Does that make you horny?
First, I plan to soil myself. Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move. Any thoughts?
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I have something to tell you.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
What is it now?
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Sea bass.
Right.
Hi.
In due time.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
Blow me.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
How's Austin?
Well, it's kind of weird.
No, he's really evil.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
He said if it vanished, he'd know it was ... you who betrayed him. He took a huge risk. The ultimate test.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
What are you trying to do to me?
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
You.
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
Do you?
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
June, July ... August?
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
Why should they think that?
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Do you always drive this fast?
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
Where am I?
You followed me.
Because you always obey orders ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
It's called Black Leather.
What is it?
You first.
But --
Mrs. Peel?
Still a bit chilly ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
I know all this.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Insane ... ?
Guilty until proven innocent?
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
All right!
Five thousand dollars.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
I love that car.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Nice shot.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
Good...
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
I don't believe you.
Let's go.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Why is Cole here?
Great bathing suit.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
What the hell are you doing?
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Where'd she go?
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Oooooo.
How'd it go?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Is he...
You gotta let me finish --
-- He killed people --
It doesn't go like that.
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Hey! You don't know me --
Ya love it, probie?
-- C'mon, Stephen.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
How do you know?
-- What were they doing there?
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Well, you did invite me here.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
Thanks for the invite.
I was doing my job.
I don't know anything about it.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
That's a dumb thing to say.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Where are you going?
Read.
I don't guess.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
What the hell are you doing here?
So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
Brian?
Four months?
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
So, you surviving without me?
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
He just wants to --
We gotta roll, Stevie...
I'll be there.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Who's this?
You don't know him.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
Who?
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I forgive you.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
What money?
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
He gots to be did.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
Seconds and thirds, too.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
I won't do it anymore.
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
I've never been given a fair shot.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
We think so.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
It's been a long time.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
He never showed it.
Nobody told me anything.
What point is that?
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Hello.
You've said that already.
Same here.
Thanks.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Light?
He, I'm Mona.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
Oh her.
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
How be dat?
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Never read a book in my whole life.
You're sure this is a good idea.
That is none of your business.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
O'Grady.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
Is Miss Dugan well?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
All Europe shall hear of this!
For whom else have you worked?
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Will we always leave it at this?
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Was he cheated?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Good night, papa.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
You saw West's body.
Do what?
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Roberto, what the fuck?
We just want to check your pack --
Bullshit.
But you didn't.
No. I said Dunbar.
Who killed Pike?
What the hell are you talking about --
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
You're kidding.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
That was kid gloves?
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
I didn't shoot West...
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Yeah.
Four --
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Really.
Think it'll work?
What are you talking about?
Pike, please --
So you took off your shirt?
We just want --
No one else heard it?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
It won't work --
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
So?
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
What is this place?
I brought it.
Will.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Did you see that woman?
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
You must be Edward Bloom.
Please. Go. Just go.
Hi. How are you feeling?
Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
Really?
You know anyone's who's taken it?
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
Am I?
Really.
You know where the chemicals are?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
Dad!
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Let's get out of here.
Wait! I need those!
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I don't believe it!
I'm going with you.
Mmm.
I need you on my side.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
You first.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me �150.
You know what for.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
What?
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
No.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Oh Jesus.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
Today is bath day.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
No I don't.
I know you just want to punish me --
In every sense. If at all possible.
What? No you're not..
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Have you got your passport?
It's none of your business.
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Please, there's no... Oh.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Thank Christ for that.
No.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
You know you can come under the blanket.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
Yeah, I know.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
This was very sweet of you.
That'd be nice.
No, ma'am.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
You wanna go home?
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Better'n me?
Let go...
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
I give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. Get you to the kitchen. You need the bathroom, it'll reach.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
LET ME GO!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
I know that.
This Rae... you get with her?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
What'chu sayin'?
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
You get a call from Rose?
Or what?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
Keep the change on that.
I feel better. Do you?
What happened to your face?
The hell you call me?
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
What are you doing?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
Hey, when in Rome --
Where're you going, Ichiro?
Did I say that?
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
I want to yank Kobo.
I want to go talk to him.
Nick, you can't do this.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
A wife.  She left.
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
What do you chant?
You'll get Ich killed.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Save it, I already took the tour.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
One guy do all the damage?
Why?
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
Where?
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
Why are you staring at us?
Like what?
When?
Yeah.  I got it.
Day after tomorrow.
What about a summary then.
And what in your estimation works?
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
Vodka!
Shot of vodka, please.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
Sorry.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
What's that?
Yeah?
My job is here.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Yeah?
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
How do you mean 'exploited'?
Are you for real?
Why should I be?
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
It would be my child.
Yeah.
Who is this?
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
You mean a woman?
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
What's up?
Go ahead.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
Don't move.
Of course.
You want to go home?
Where are your folks?
They left.
I'm hungry, J.F.
Whatcha doin'?
Twenty.
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
I'm Adam Webber.
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
For how long?
Let's go talk first, Adam.
Are you French?
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
No, I'm lost.
I just had a mental picture of...
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Do you own a car?
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
You don't?
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
Yes.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Wait!  Wait!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I can't, it's yours.
Why doesn't it never work out?
Doing what?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Who are these people?
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
This is for me.
The big one!
I didn't know that.
When do you need her by?
Now, get out!!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Um-hum.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
The guy with the underpants!
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
I certainly do!
No it's not!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
...I do.
How do I leave here?
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Tempus fugit!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
It's so small.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
What?
Does that work?
Bye, Troy!
Bye, Adam!
My father is a genius.
I don't see anything!
Help you?
Sure.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
Are you in trouble, son?!
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
It's time.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
The locks.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
I've noticed.
Calvin?!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
If we still have one.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
He didn't leave with them.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
Oh, no!
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Then what?
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Yes?
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
Who knows you have these?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Then you got undressed.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Nothing. Are you alright?
Do you like me?
No. What is happening?
Nice guy. Who's he?
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Don? Are you in with them?
It used to make me laugh, but.
I sure don't hate you.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
You like to open me, don't you?
Yeah, it's me.
Hold me, Don.
Bull.
MOMMY!
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Okay Frank.
There ya go.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
What else is new? Right?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Are you alright?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
What's the plan.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Okay, okay.
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Everything okay?
It's good to see you.
Where to?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
No Jeffrey!!
I need Il Duce.
There's ways around that.
Lord's name.
Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know!
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
What?! What are you doin'?
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
How many?
He got beat up by a girl.
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
I'm serious.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Where the fuck are you going?
Now, you will receive us.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Rule of thumb?
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
Where's my cat?
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
No way they could have seen it?
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
What are you serious?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Roc. You okay?
So?
What the fuck do you mean?
We'll keep going, Roc.
You believe?
Yes.
Have you no fear of God?
Why?
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
This is he?
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Where are you going?
Eight dollars.
But he didn't say anything.
Is it back in?
I keep it for emergencies.
Look at the treads on those.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
I'll say it.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
She's from Cuba.
Obviously. That's a given.
We said 48 hours.
When'd he tell you?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
I'm not. But there's --
Sixteen dollars.
How much?
Who's in the car?
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
He doesn't want to fight.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to Scarecrow.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Who tripped the alarm?
Wait for Kumar.
You're kidding.
What?
Why?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
This is good.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Sixty days?
Were you born in Mexico?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Is that him?
That's Anthony.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Not even for emergencies?
I can't believe you said that.
That's your domain.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
His name was Swifty?
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
This could be a trap.
Do you have your own cell?
And what does that cover?
Why?
Where's that guy going?
Let's talk about Conklin.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
Do you know what his budget was?
May I finish?
Berlin!
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
'Why' would be enough for me.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
Jesus...
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
Yes...
I can't let you do that either.
What's going on in Berlin?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
Yes.
You hear me? I believed you.
So when was I here?
No. You never worked Berlin.
Where am I?
Why am I alive?
What?
Here?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Anything?
Someone dead from this household?
It was in Latin, sir.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
Young Robert, we are honored --
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
Wallace has sacked York!
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
You mock us with a smile?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Good to see you again.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
I'm dreaming.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
Who would do such a thing?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Why? What for?
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
Why do you ask?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
I don't know. These things take time.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
What do you want to know, Evan?
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
So it didn't feel... weird?
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
Different? How?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Which is?
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Remember, everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
It didn't feel like a dream.
Can... can... Can I have this?
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Look what you made me do!
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Lung cancer?
Monsieur Rick?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Monsieur Rick, I --
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Here's to you, sir.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
A franc for your thoughts.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
And I was wondering.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Yes.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
It's been a long time.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Goodnight.
Our faithful friend is still there.
-- Yes?
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
Hello, Louis.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
This is the end of the chase.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Huh?
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
I don't want them here overnight.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Save some for tomorrow.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Feels so good to lie here.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Do too little you'll die.
No.
Nothing out there but ocean.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
I have to.
That's your dog.
Get back?  From where?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
That about sums it up.
Yeah?
It means a lot...that you came.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Can you find her?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
Hello?
To Wilson.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
Thanks.  For everything.
San Francisco.  And you?
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
What are you going to tell the little ones?
How many months are you?
Really?
People watched the movies in their cars?
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
How could you not *care* about the movie?
It will be okay.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
I can't go nowhere.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
But did you know him?
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
There was no visible wound?
Where's the name sheet?
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
I don't think so.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
I thought it was my turn.
I'm happy I amuse you.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
What's that?
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
That's it.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Where do you think you're going?
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
So how'd you get caught?
She had you tempting fate.
It's not true.
So what? We hide, right?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Fuck that. We're going too.
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Attractive girl.
What about... The money?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
No.  What's my cut?
What do I have to do?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
What about what?
Tick-tock...
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
Ten percent.
What do you want?
That's it?
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
I'm Bella.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
What's the Blue Book price?
How about five hundred.
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
Who was he?
Good night?
I've got something to tell you.
I had training. In the Republic.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
That girl, she works at the casino --
You're entitled to your opinion.
Gambling's not about money.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Here...use a spoon.
What?
Found a job?
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
In the casino.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
I know that. But you can now.
The point is, they want a man inside.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Wait a minute...
Is it yes?
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Detective Inspector Ross.
Where do you live, Jack?
You've done pretty well.
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
What happens if I want to sneeze?
I make it six.
What makes you so sure?
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Yes.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
That hair will have to go.
How do you feel, Jack?
The key!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
Oh, God...
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Hey, bomb...
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
That is correct.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
...nine seconds...
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
-- open circuit breakers --
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
You know what I think about, Talby?
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
No kidding?
Yeah?
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
It didn't work?
What're you talkin' about?
That's a lotta crap.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
What the hell are you doing?
Who's Camille?
Lemme put some clothes on.
Out there.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
Girl's gotta make a living.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
It was open.
Bent.
You need to get out more.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
Well, not me personally.
Any idea when she'll be back?
Who are you?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
As long as you're okay.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
So are dogs.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
What if he's on the level?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Really?
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
--a philandering pig.
How'd you get her out of town?
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
Easy Sketchy.
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
What the hell is that?
More than anything in the world.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
You got in the car, didn't you?
Any luck?
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
I said, I'm sorry!
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Look, you can have my wallet...
Yeah.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
You'll know soon enough.
You have to do something for me first.
What happened to your eye?
Why do they call you Frank?
Don't look so freaked.
So... you just moved here?
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
Wow. Did he go to jail?
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Who?
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Infant Memory Generators.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Grandma Death.
Frank.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
Yes.
What about your family, Donnie?
Can anyone else see him?
How does that make you feel?
I know.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Why?
What is going to happen?
Frank is going to kill.
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Why would I tell Mom?
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Gerald.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
It is a big deal.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Where is she?!
So, what do I say?
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
I'm gonna need more caps.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
We was robbed.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes...
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
Yeah.
So what was the theme of the pageant last year?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Becky was my only shot at state!
That's enough!
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
"My dear"...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
"My dear President"...
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
Who to?
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back.
What's the matter with you?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Yankee Poodle.
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
I don't wanna work at all.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
My card.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
Sure.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
Firefly must be captured at any cost.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
Are you getting tired?
Are you sure you're not tired?
$50?
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Go ahead.
Once more!
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
Oh -- you mean... worm?
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Yes?
What is it?
Like this.
Never mind that, I want my man!
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
I want him back!
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Oh yes?
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Has the response picked up?
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Good day...!
Thank you very much.
...Yyes
Merrick...
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Not at all, John.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
The Children. Where are your children
...my... home?
Oh no, I couldn't.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Watery headed bunch.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Very smart indeed.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
Right! Where is he?
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
It's all right! It isn't happening!
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
It was different...
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
I've never LOVED anybody!
You're as bad as my father.
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
What do you see, Erik?
Is there nothing men can do?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
I'll tell you what...
But it IS! Look!
Have you done this sort of thing before?
What about the raping?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
I don't suppose... no...
Well you started it.
Louder.
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
Why should you care?
Why... should YOU care?
Why should you care?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
We're missing all the fun...
What's it all about?
I met this girl...
What "magic"?
So?
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
That's better.
No! Let go, Snorri!
I think we should go...
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
Vanish into thin air?
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Sh! Hurry!
I can't swim! I can't swim!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
There is nothing we can do...
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Ms. Kruczynski?
Oh, Tangerine.
I'm sorry.
Really?
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
You're sure? It's cold.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Frost?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
How can you watch this crap?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
More?
Such a beautiful view.
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
You remember what happened next?
What?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Yeah.
I'm sure, I said.
But you weren't. I could tell.
Is that what you want?
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
I love her.
Me too. There's this poem --
Seems too coincidental that way.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
So you'll call me, right?
Yeah.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
What took you so long?
I just walked in.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
What? What do you mean?
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
I miss you.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Stan... c'mon...
You found us okay?
That's a good one.
How did I look?
Hi.
Nothing.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
Did you try going through C-Gate?
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
The voltage looks fine.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
Is everything getting worse?
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
A traveler, eh?
Tell me about it.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
For magazines?
A born freak can only go uphill.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
Coop, where are you...
The containment, Second Containment...
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
Coffee.
You weren't there. I saw it.
What's wrong?
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
It's insane.
If it worked.
The date.
What do you want me to say?
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
You can't, your orders are specific...
I told you... She won't let you leave...
What are you talking about?
Heading three-three-four...
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
I just finished drying...
It tastes bad.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
You've got to listen...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
Blow it up?
First time in a grav couch?
He's been past Mars?
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were...
You can't do that.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
What is it?
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
About me? How sweet.
What is this? Where's Reed?
What did you wish for, honey?
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
The shields on the station should protect us.
You got a chisel round here?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
We're working as hard as we can --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
'Course not. Strictly business.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
I though we went over this.
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Front page?
I, uh, think I remember the number.
You're happy for me and Victor.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
I think it was a little more complicated than --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Come on, Ben, come on...
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
'Scuse me.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Is everything okay at work?
I'm just guessing.
You are a virgin!
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Do you have any ice tea?
What? Are you all right?
Oh. Hi.
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
Did you get her number?
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Did you go home and get it?
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
You're losing it, Damone.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Don't you like him?
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
What variables?
It was okay.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
What's Doug do in Chicago?
What do you think?
What do you think it is?
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Where's Doug?
He's not coming.
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
If you graduate.
That's a nice shirt.
Thanks for coming to get me.
This is a nice car.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
No. That's okay.
I don't know.
...I've got to go home.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Where ya comin' from, young man?
Jesus! Did I say that?
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Where's the medicine?
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
I want to leave fast.
When does this thing stop?
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Plans?
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
Read the newspapers.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
No, she's looking for you.
What is this?
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
So do we, lady.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
You realize...
I will not die because of him!
Well, it don't look pretty.
Stop it.
Where's that?
Wha?
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
You all sure about this?
What?
Your parents of relation?
Will I go crazy or something?
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Huh?
What's it for!?
Nine?
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Let's go.
Get to your cars!
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
Oh. I mean, good.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
My clothes?
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
He's not here.
You don't think I'm good enough?
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Who?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
No?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
Harry!
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
...I see.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I know that, Dad, but --
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Why... yes.
Then don't go to Hollywood.
...Not if I can help it.
What?
Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  Hey!
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
You think I'd miss it?
Well? What'd you think?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Frances...
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Frances...
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
Where are we, mean man?
I guess.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
There's just one more thing.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
Frances! Frances!
Yeah. I don't know.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
I'm not sure.
Yeah.
Shit!
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
But I want to. I'm trying!
You think I got it?
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
What's wrong?
I'll be back.
I'm back, Mama.
Haven't you heard what I said?
It ain't for lack of trying.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Is there something else?
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
Why?
You're an outcast.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
You speak.
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
This was not taken from a grave.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
It's been months. It's not like him.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
You make me weak.
Your decision. For us.
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
I am not mad.
Are you having me on?
They'll hang him all the same.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
No. He had more important work.
Thank you, Henry.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
Preposterous.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Melvin Belli.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
You want to leave?
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
How come you're leaving?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
I had to.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
It's gonna be a long summer.
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
I don't love Neddy.
Ned!
Looks like a storm.
It's beautiful...
Anything else you want?
How much do I owe you?
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
What was that?
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
In heaven.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Didn't like it, did ya?
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
What's this stuff?
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
What?
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
I wasn't scratching!
You believe me don't cha?
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Do they have cable?
Do they have a waterbed?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Feels good.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Seth, if you were me --
They're gonna search the van.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
How are you?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
You could take their head off.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Thank you, sir.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
Same rules for everyone, sir.
Straight up?
Aw, what is this...
Shit.  Think we're had.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
Which is guy-speak for...
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
What about him.
I don't know, I don't care.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
I'd sure like to know who.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
You really came back for more?  Of this?
They had to kill 'em?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Permission to get dressed, sir?
It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
Do you?
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
I just wonder how that happened.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
I'll take them all.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
Did Romeo have a name?
I can't.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
We've met before.
Sounds like a big company.
It's the French Secret Service.
Oh.
Sure.
So you're in?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
How do I do that?
What'd they say?
Who the hell are you?
Hello?
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
"The show must go on."
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
Go ahead!
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
Not again...
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
You have a better plan, Alex?
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
Okay...  Okay, now what.
Yes Commander?
Lt. Madison, GO.
Structural damage at 68 percent.
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
What's the weather like outside?
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Where are the miners?
They're still behind us...
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
What?
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Are they behind us?
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
never doubted you for a second.
You're kidding. When for?
Unbelievable.
You gotta admit, they do love him.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Simpler.
I... certainly, but-
Commander?... Where are you... going?
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Mathesar? What is that?
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Could be this.
Oh, right, sorry.
It doesn't have eyes.
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Continue forward, sir?
WHAT? WH
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
Well, what have you thought?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Who is that!?
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
The British army, sir!
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
The man is a traitor!
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
I feel the same, sir.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
To win this war I need an army.
But, you do come from a military family?
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Or, 'civilized'.
They can use their imaginations.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
So where's the money?
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
What about her?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
I really think I can be of service on this one.
I can't do it.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Who is this?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Yeah? Which terminal?
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
I want you to.
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.
Part of it, yeah.
But you work for the casino?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -� this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer �-
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
One of his best parts.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
I had to tell 'em something.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Yeah, he told me.
It was in the Herald.
So you want to know.
One we're producing.
That's not bad.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
They report it to the IRS.
You've been losing.
I'm up twelve grand today.
We call you a taxi.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons �-
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Right. See how your story ends.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
Pick 'n' Save.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
Hello, Doris.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
You don't? What happened to Muff?
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
What's so great about Sweden?
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
One more?
You think that's funny
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
What're you crazy?
Maybe that is his boat.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
What's this?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Or somebody stopped them.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
What is it?
So. I got a question. Just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
What's slow?
Morning everybody.
That's a good thing?
What'd he look like?
What?
Candy?
You're more practical than superstitious.
The guy. He just came this way.
There's somebody else on this boat.
What?
Collision? With what?
But where's the damage?
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
It's not gonna hold us.
Victims of what?
Of course they did.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
You're up late.
Say what?
What about the gold?
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Give up?
Yup.
What is it now?
I guess.
Pumpkin, are you in there?
About what?
Yeah, I heard about that.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
What do you mean?
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
But I was only trying to be friendly...
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Hey - why do you have this?
There's my dad with Joanie.
He's insane!
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter...  Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
Ew, look at this...
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
"Funky"?
Let's go hassle Josh.
How about this one?
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
No, really...
What thing?
Hello?
How repulsive!
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
He came into work.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
I dunno...
Do you want anything?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Norman.
Well why do I care about that?
Do you have any old Indian records?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
Oh, right...
Jesus!
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
I really don't think it's a good idea.
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
So, why did you bring this along?
Yeah, but still...
What? Why?
You can open your eyes now.
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Oh yeah?
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Hi, it's me...
Boo!
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
...I better not...
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
In whatever way you think I mean.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
But, I...
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
Let me see the sick.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
Understand, I had help-
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
Very good indeed.
Anything special about them?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
I don't suppose I could watch.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
What a good week.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.
What happened to them?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Janosz?
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Oh no.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
Hello, Peter.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
His name is Oscar.
That's where the buggy stopped.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Are you all squeaky clean now?
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
Should we go?
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
I command you.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Like what?
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
Pretty impressive, huh?
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Who?  Who?  Who?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
Now that's one ugly dude.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Is it a star?
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
You really don't act like a scientist.
Uh-huh.
Are you all right?
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
That's it.  Get out.
On a purely scientific basis.
All right.
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Can't you tell me now?
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
But why?  The students love us!
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Oh, that's very - unusual.
I'm not at liberty to say.
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
Circle?
Nervous?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
What have you got, Egon?
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
Does she want to be?
All right.  I'll try.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Where's the Keymaster?
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Looked at with your eyes.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
What do I say?
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
How do you know?
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Who was the architect?
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Judgement Day ...
I should at least have you, don't you think?
That's difficult to say, general.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
I don't know...
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
But have never been?
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
You're hearing about somebody else.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
I was summoned.
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
Who the hell are you?
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
Before they leave, get gold.
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Could you do it?
I want to go home.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
Where we going?
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
All right.
Why aren't you ready?
That woman --
I've never been to it.
Did you say rape her?
Let me go.
No.
But Elaine --
We just can.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Why wouldn't it?
Yes.
Ben.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
Who screamed?
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Mr. McCleery?
You heard me. Out of here.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
A single room or a double room?
Where is it?
What?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
No.
No.
What?
What?
What is wrong with me?
Thank you.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
But they would! Don't you see?
Oh my God.
Let me out!
That's fine.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
The number.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Well.
Benjamin.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Thank you.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
You can admit that, can't you?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
That you're afraid --
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Don't you?
Always?
We're talking.
Now let's keep going here.
Right.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Man, is this interesting.
Is it?
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
And you were a student also.
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
Benjamin?
Yes.
Are you?
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Now don't start this.
What are you doing?
But if it's sickening for you --
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
No -- actually I'm not --
Nothing else.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
That has nothing to do with it --
Say that again.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Oh no.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
No, I don't.
Why?
HUH?
I'd like to discuss this.
Turn 'em up.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
With the pearls?
What about the money?
I have an idea working in my head...
Who?
Dictation.  You know...
Chasing what?
I'll do anything for you.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
So --
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
I'm worried about you.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
What, Doctor?
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Yes.
You're trembling.
You dance splendidly.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Money!
Yes, of course, -- money!
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
What...! --
Moreover...
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
You're sweet.
Oh, no.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
No water -- What a place!
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
How clear is Manchester?
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
We will wait.
Four minutes past. Please come.
I know -- I know.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
You're calling the shots.
No.
You ever hear about the oranges?
And if you do it wrong?
You're a thousand percent right!
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Here you are! Two rich people!
Well, make it stop!
Yes, yes, but that's --
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
I know.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
So I heard.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
As though you do what I say.
And Myra's stuff?
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
You're getting off the grift?
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
Are you sure?
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
No.
You already went back to work.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
Atascadero.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
What?
Bullshit!
) What?
Sure. Let's get it over.
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
You take all your dates here. Blake?
That's it?
Carter.
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
I think someone broke into my house.
Nothing's missing?
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Where are you going?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Where'd you get it?
Then you come out here.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
Who?!
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
Are you going to leave, too?
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Shane's going as a condom.
You're so easy...
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Where's Shane?
He do that to you?
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
But I've seen him!
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Who are you?
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
What is that?
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Home is important to a man.
Um.
Home.
You know what gets me?
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.

Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Why?
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
There.
You have my word.  As a gentleman
How do you get your hair to look like that?
Sure have.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
She's not a...
You know Chastity?
Have fun tonight?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I was?
Well, no...
Then that's all you had to say.
But
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
What good stuff?
The "real you".
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
No
Wow
She okay?
They do to!
Did you change your hair?
No.
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Who?
Great
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Is he oily or dry?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
It's more
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Queen Harry?
Neat...
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Hi, Joey.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Where've you been?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
What do you think?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
What's normal?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
You are so completely unbalanced.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
What?
In 9th.  For a month
But you hate Joey
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
You did what?
But
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Let go!
You set me up.
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But she doesn't want to date.
Daddy, I --
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God.  It's starting.
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
No, but
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
I'm missing something.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You the new guy?
So they tell me...
So -- which Dakota you from?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
That I'm used to.
That girl -- I --
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
You know French?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What about him?
What makes you think he'll do it?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
I thought you hated those people.
You got him involved?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Number one.  She hates smokers
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
You told me that part already.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
What've you got for me?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
You makin' any headway?
She kissed me.
What's the worst?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Away.
Leave my sister alone.
Yeah
Two legs, nice rack...
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I just upped my price
What?
Forget it.
It's about time.
How'd you do it?
Do what?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Hey.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
What's this?
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Does it matter?
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Pick you up Friday, then
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
You hate me don't you?
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
You -- covered in my vomit.
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
You're not a big talker, are you?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
What's this?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
You're not okay.
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
This is so patronizing.
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Why'd you let him get to you?
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
Kat! Wake up!
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
I should do this.
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Oh, so now you think you know me?
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Put your right foot there --
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
The Partridge Family?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
A soft side? Who knew?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You up for it?
State trooper?
The duck?
Hearsay.
Tell me something true.
I hate peas.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Is that a request or a command?
You know what I mean
No.
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
What?
That ' s completely adorable!
Wait I...
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
I know.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
My insurance does not cover PMS
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
When I go?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Tempestuous?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
You think?
Macbeth, right?
Kat a fan, too?
Say it
What?
What plan?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
You were right. She's still pissed.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
I missed you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Touch of the flu.
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
You're completely demented.
In the microwave.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Tumescent!
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Have a great time, honey!
What just happened?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
He's the devil's child...
We should have seen land.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Your life, and that of others!
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
The Judgment is ours!
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
You can see for yourself.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I could be gone for years.
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
She said yes.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
You don't usually ask.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
Can't you stay with us a little?
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
How far from here?
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I want to go with you!
There'll be a time.
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I have to explore the mainland.
How are you feeling, Fernando?
Father...
What does he say?
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No...
No?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
I'm not bargaining!
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
You defend yourself admirably...
What...?  Do I have so many already?
All I have to do is call the guards.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Say not here!  Cuba!
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
You come!  You speak first!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Thousands.
To bring the word of God.
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
He understands.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
God... That's in a week!
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
Why do you wish to sail west?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Colon!
All of them!  Just lies!
I am listening, my son.
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
The ocean is uncrossable?
What did they say about Granada before today?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
May I speak freely?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
How old are you, Senor Colon?
Do they have such thoughts?
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
We don't need to know.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
And what do you think Mendez?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
What's he doing?
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Where can I meet this man?
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
We're lost!
The land is there.  I know it!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
You tell that to them!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying.  But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your Majesty.
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Then why?
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Don't say anything.
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
You bring the cigarettes?
I was all of these.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What about Oleg?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut?  How much?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
But it's...
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Your mother was blind?
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
Divorced.
I can't take you to my place.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
So...the station is empty?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
I know.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
They're not gonna send you right back.
Are you alright?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Is he your boyfriend?
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
What are you doing?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
A cop?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Who did cause and origin?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
No!  Nothing happened.
Chief - mind if I take her?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
End my career?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
But Chief?  Over this??
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
Yeah, right.
What was that, Korfin?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Vodka tonic.
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
I'm gonna propose.
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
What's he looking for?
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
Yeah.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
Are you hit?
Who's there?
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
What's wrong?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
What are you saying?
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
You know what that is, right?
No, what is it?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
What would you call her?
I'll come with you.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I'll let you know what happens.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
You thirsty?
Of course.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Why not?
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
So...who's Nicky?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
What's your accomplishment.
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Is it drug related?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Eddie, are you okay?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Hey, honey.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Stop it.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You're ruthless.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Answer the phone.
Answer it.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
That's good.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Promise?
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Okay, til tonight.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Okay.
See you later.  Good luck.
Thank you.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
How old are your kids?
So what's unique?
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
That's unique.
Ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Okay.  You ready?
Any chance we can do that again?
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
I am butcher.
You stuff sausage in it.
And what do you do with the bones?
Are you married?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh, look, you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
Where's your partner?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Hi, I'm Honey.
Where's Czech girl?
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
Where is escort service?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Give me the address!!
Next.  Could I see your documents, please?
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Two weeks holiday.
I have five-hundred dollars.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Yes.
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Is there a problem?
We are both from Prague.
How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Who is he?
This all you want?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Don't fool around.
Did you hear what I said?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Don't speak Russian!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
What?
Turn that fucking thing off!
Speak English!
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
Get in the bathroom!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Shut up.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
I did.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Why not?
What is that?
Let me get a shot of it.
Sit down!
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Credit?
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
You got that?
No, I don't get that!
Traitor!!
Emil???!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Did you hurt her?
We spent it!
Ha. Ha.
I can get you a job.
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
Robert...?
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Isn't he a little moody?
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Yeah?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
I know.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Well, he...
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright.  Go ahead.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Yes...he's my friend.
I speak English.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
New York.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A cheap hotel.
What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
No.  Go ahead.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
That's what it looks like to me.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What was that?
I'll take him.
No way!  He's mine!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Well, he killed my partner!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
I'll send a cop back for you.
You okay?
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Yeah?  What kind?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Mouth's clean, too.
Clean?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
He knew all along.
What??
What?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
How long they been livin' here?
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Aren't you tired?
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
How was it?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
What are you gonna do?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
Your doctor?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?

Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes?
That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
It's possible.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, I thought so.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
Well, that's something.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Good morning. How's it going?
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
I don't know. Hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
Hal?
It's the last one.
I guess not.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
What is it, Hal?
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.

I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Are you coming to my party?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
When are you coming home?
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
How many days until you come home?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Thank you, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
How is gregor?
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
How do you do, Mr. Miller?
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Really?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
That's right.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Certainly.
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Any ideas about the colour?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Thank you.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
I will if I can, Frank.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Five by five, Frank.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Yeah?
Name?
This is three years old.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
How about chargin' the battery?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Yeah.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Now how's your memory doin'?
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I want to drive awhile.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pay money?
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, what about me?
I'm candy...
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You're in a hurry.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
What's the matter with my place?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Hello, again.
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
How about it?
I hear you've got visitors.
Would you guys...
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You're gonna help us take him.
No chance.
Where's ganz?
You lying son of a bitch...
After I get outta this, cop...I'm gonna live forever...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
You're done.  End of story.
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
You here to write my life story?
Yeah, I noticed...
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Yeah?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
You're crazy.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
No way to start a partnership.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Yeah.
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Thank you.
What do you think?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station?
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Now, where we goin', convict?
I don't give out the details.
Last night.
Sure.  Then we had a fight this morning.
Well?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Hey, you wanna bet?
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
What are you talkin' about?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
There.
Let's go.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
How much?
Half a million.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
He's after your money.
We split 50-50?
Not likely, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Where's the money?
Right, partner.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Where's the goddamn car?
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
What?
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
No class...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
You stay with me...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
What about Luther?
We missed.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah, I see her.
That was quick.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
It's late, they're closing...
Do I get to kiss her too?
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Hey, there she is...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Partnership?
You okay?
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Thanks.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah...
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
What the bell happened?
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
I didn't have the time.
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
That's what you say, Cates...
Yeah.
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Billy Bear...
Who are all these?
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Tell me that's not the same guy.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
You look awful.
So do you...been a long day.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Bullshit red tape.
I got to wait for a call.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
A cop...
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
When? How?
What am I wanted for?
I don't think your gun's loaded...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
Hey, you're right.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
I guess he got the message...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Thanks for the coffee.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Jack, are you okay?
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
Jack, wait...
Hello.
Hey, I don't believe it.
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No sign of the Indian.  Airport's clean.  Train station. Bus station.  Docks... Shit...
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
How do you know?
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
So what?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Whaddya think?
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Three more hours...
Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Tell me.
Who the hell are you?
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Hard man to live with.
How would you know?
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Hey...
Shut up.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?
Stall.
Keep stallin'.
How hot are they?
How ya doin'?
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Surprise, Luther.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
When?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You chickenshit punk...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
Let her go.
Rosalie, you okay?
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
You sure?
How much?
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Give it back.
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
What're you laughing about?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
...We're saved!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
...would you like a drink?
No thank you.
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
You are a monster, Zorg!
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
Who are you?
I brought the girl remember?
He's a she!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
So you do know her.
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
It means, "Never without my permission".
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Of course.
What are you doing?
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
And then?
Is there anything that can stop it?
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
What is?
What's she doing?
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
They really made her...
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Who?
Leeloo... is... she's...
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
I was talking to the cat.
At least, the cat comes back.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
I just found a picture of you.
How do I look?
I don't need one.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
Hello?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
...Priest...
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Eto Akta Gamat!
...What's your name?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
The Fifth Element...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
...Hello?
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Hi Ma...
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Other than that... You all right?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Yeah?
Hello?
You little sleaze bag!
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
30 seconds...
6... 5...
...Hi.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I don't think this is a good time...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Six to the left. One to the right.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
You know how to fly this thing?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Is that all?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
What mission?
To save the world.
Where have I heard this song before?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Just one... why me?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
Don't you open your messages?
I've had enough good news for today
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
...Shit!
It's my wife.
I thought you were divorced.
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Apipoulai!
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Cornelius..
Dinoine chagantakat!
Love...
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Finished what?
Learning language.
Which one?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
Here we go again...
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You noticed..
Where you going?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
You're nothing but a... a...
I'm so very sad.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
It's up to you now, Angel!
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
...Like love...
Exactly.
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Why?... Why would you need me?
Tell me...
Not going to open?
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
At least I won lunch.
Been here long?
Uh..
It's not?
Thanks..
This is all that survived?
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Talk English Doc.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
This thing solid?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
I want your best man on this!
They just landed in the desert.
Staedert, do you read me?
Is that better?
Perfect, Mr. President.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
Options.
Wait or act.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Yes, Sir!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Am I disturbing you?
...Not far, now.
Got it.
How's our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Welcome home.
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
I love you.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I know.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Why the gun?
Hello?
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
What happened to you?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
Tom...
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You should have.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
You're killing me...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Who are you calling?
What?
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
What are these?
Anything harder?
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What do you want?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Bullshit.
I'm telling you...
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Dino...
What the fuck... !
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
You said something about money.
That's five thousand dollars.
Is it?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Machine.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
We can do that.
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Machine's in?
Where's that?
Excellent.
Where are the women?
What are these for?
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
What are you... ?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Look, I don't know what this...
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
Friend of yours?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
You're a dead man.
Leave him alone.
... sorry...
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
Call me Tom.
Alright, Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
We do.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Why don't they come to me?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
I'm not so sure about this.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Any good?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
What's he talking about?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Why?
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
You enjoy it?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
Nobody saw you bring her in?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
What did you do with her body?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Keep moving.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
Where?  Show me where.
Do it.
Don't think I won't.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Look, you cocksucker...
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
You are a private investigator?
That's right.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
I was well compensated.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Never mind how I found you.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
They're no friends of mine.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Shut up.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut your mouth and drive!
You're making me very angry.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You're asking me why?
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Enlighten me.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
He's lying.
Big date tonight?
Yeah... guess so.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Pardon me?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Truman Capote.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Remember me?
I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
How long you been working there?
Three, four years.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Max.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
There's not much illegal.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
I'm not a cop.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Not quite.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much do you make now?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Sounds good, pops.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
Interesting theory.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
Child pornography.
Snuff films.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
How old are you?
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
What about me?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A daughter.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Specialty product.
You're learning.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Wha... ?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Who is he, his name?
You don't need to be here.
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
What's next?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
What's this?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Uh huh, pleasure.
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
My condolences.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
He succeeded.
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
I'm afraid I don't...
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
No.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
You... you need to go to the police.
You don't have any other choice.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
It won't work like that.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
Okay...
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Okay, I follow you so far...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
You're joking.
Hello... ?
I'm here.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Okay.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
You told me to look, so I looked.
Hello?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you?  Having any luck?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
How will I get it to you?
Yes... ?
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
I don't understand, who are... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Yes, but...
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
Neil... Neil Cole.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
No.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
What was she running from?
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
Yes.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I didn't mean to...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
We're all like that.
Are you religious?
No.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
What?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know.  I think so.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
How... how can you say that to me...?
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
It's been six years.
Hello... ?
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I remember.  You just left...
What are you talking about... ?
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Who is this... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Who are you?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
No... no... no...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Yes... I remember Mary
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
What is this?
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night.  The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman.  It's unpleasant, I know.  I apologize...
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
No, you may not.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Rick...I can't.
Alice, you think you can leave?
What's wrong?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
You alright?
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
It was bad.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Hey, since when do you play Thomas Edison?  This looks like Sheila's.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
I can't go back to sleep again.
We'll figure it out.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
I'm sure they're around.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
Sounds like a game show host to me.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
You what?
Kristen, what happened?
You in a hurry?
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Ohhhhbaby, I am dead on my feet.
We have matching luggage.
You've been up all night?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
No...
You're his sister, right?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
I've been working double shifts.
Extra money, huh?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Not really.
Is there something we can do?
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Then what else can we do?
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
Here we are.
What the hell was that?
You look great!
Rick, please.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
Hey, Rick!
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Nice neighborhood.
Hey man, we're all sorry...
Been up with Alice.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
About Freddy?
Something the matter with the cuisine?
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
What's wrong with me?
I'm sorry honey, but...
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Something wrong with the stairs?
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What is it?
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Feeling better now?
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
I gotta get out of here.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Excuse us, dear.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Hey...wake up.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
How did you know that?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Is that who you're waiting for?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Who says I don't like you?
Mommy...?
Where is he?
What do you mean?
But how...?
Jesus!  Don't do that!
The tickets.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
About him?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
Yeah...I guess.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
You're right.
There you go.  Love you.
I was afraid you weren't coming.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Dad!
Where are we going?
Thanks for everything, Dad.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
I'm so sorry, honey...
How was the meeting?
Sobering...
Very funny.
Alice...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
Alice!
I've got to go.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
But Dad --
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Did everyone call everyone?
What's that got to do with it?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
What?
But how are we gonna --
You do good work, Alice.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I've got to write some of this down.
Mark, are you okay?
I thought about that.
Then get out!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
Who's Jacob?
My baby!
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
Where are you going?
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
But I've seen her grave.
Poor woman...
I don't understand.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Who?
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
Vomit?
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
Mark...
It's okay.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
You could train someone else.
Your 'out.'  This came for you.
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Yes?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
I don't know.
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Reef!
So they caught up with you, too?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
Huh?
I guess.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Cyclops?
We're stuck tight!
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
'Us?'
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
I think you're right.
Yeah?
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Well?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Dave - !
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Seems to be all around...
Course and speed?
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
What course, Skipper?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Yes, Griff?
Something wrong?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Why do you say that?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Wonderful!
Now they feel it...down below.
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
Anything ---
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
Under <u>water</u>?
...above Murmansk, and Finland.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
As we near the Pole...
There's got to be an explanation!
All ready?
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Who with?
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
Huh?
What do you think?
That's what I said!
But - what can we accomplish?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
What?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
That's a <u>face</u>???
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Swell!
He did!
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Obviously.
My yeoman will show you to your quarters.
See what?
Well, I'll be - !
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
Are you alright, Wade?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Twombley involved?
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
What are you boys up to?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Yeah. I know about that.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
This spring.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
You heard the news.
I hear Twombley got shot.
You see it?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
I'm okay.
I used to play ball.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
Oh.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
What happened?
Yeah.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Don't mind if I do.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
No brag. Just fact.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
How'd you get the job?
Like you and Gordon?
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Where'd Twombley get shot?
No, I mean whereabouts.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Sure you did.
What?
Saw him do it?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Open the door, will ya?
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
I don't care. They're out.
Why do they do that?
Do what?
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Was it funny?
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I called Mommy.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.
Jesus, why?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Dad.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It belongs to Pop.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
How about a Big Mac?
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Okay.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
I want to go home.
That's illegal, you know.
You're a policeman.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
I want to go home.
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
Where's the plow?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Don't go playing policeman.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Fuck you.
What's the hurry?
Huh?
I figured you already heard.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.
How you holding up, Wade?
I'm fine, fine.
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
What do I have to do for it?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You? Why?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Want to buy?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
Yeah.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
It's just...
Wait there. She'll be right out.  Is there snow on the ground up in Lawford?
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
For a while.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Said what?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
You don't mean that.
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Call me.
Tonight. Let's get together.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Money.
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
You knew me as a kid.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
What way?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Then... I guess you have to.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Oh, Wade.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
You've been married twice --
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Strange.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
This is nuts.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Going somewhere, Margie?
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Coffee's perked.
When did she die?
It makes me sad.
Can --?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Hold on!
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Yes. Here's your ticket.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Something about my father?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Take care, Wade.
It don't look right.
What?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
This town sucks.
Marg!
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jack?
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
His office. You mean my old office.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
Rolfe.
Just do it.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Nothing.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Sleeping.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Where's Ma?
Yeah.
Is there something wrong with the phone?
In the living room.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Yeah.
Bang!
Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
Wade?
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
Twombley.
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Who?
What happened?
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
What about Margie?
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Find them everywhere.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
A hunting accident is perfect.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
I was thinking about that story you told me, about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
Wade, are you alright?
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I'm sure he's busy.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
Alice...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
I'm sorry, honey.
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Your father never means to be so...
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Some kids were teasing you?
Mom?
Yes dear?
Daddy. Daddy, please...
I don't drink coffee.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
He didn't leave us.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How was...  ...the ballet?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Alice!
Daddy...
How you doing, sweetie?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
There they are!
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Did we warn them off?
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
It's cut.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Put your pilot on.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
How we doing, Colonel?
Uh, we got a problem here.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
We don't know that.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They aren't answering their hails.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
Sir, you threw out page two.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
Can we do that?
But they start executing hostages in
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
They still have the President, it's past their deadline and they haven't called. What do you think it means?
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
Because it is my duty.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
About goddamn time.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
That's affirmative.
We've already been inspected.
The rest of the secret service?
Dead.
How many others killed?
Nine.
Who did this?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
We're not going to make it.
Where are we now?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Stand by.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Tower, here.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
A dubious distinction, no?
And all these rooms here?
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
*                     Please tell me your name.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
You're pointing a gun at me.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
What do you want with us?
Now, or he dies, please.
Leave my daughter alone.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Yes
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
That was war.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
No.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Four...
Jim...
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Over my dead body.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Finally, we can bargain.
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
I'll not going without my family.
Sir, we stay with the President.
May I speak to you for a moment?
Can't it wait?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
You know what?
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
How did your speech go?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
I don't know why you stayed.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
What are you doing?
The fax machines.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Where are we sending it?
Someone should give you a raise.
Did they say anything about my family?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
and if that means negotiating...
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
What's going on?
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
One.
But...
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
who can I say is calling?
Yeah, right.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
I might still have a few chips left.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Other way around, sir.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
I said it's not worth the fight.  Steward, please.
You give me ulcers.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Shit.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
IT'S OPEN!
WE'RE HOOKED!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
What?
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Forget it.  I was reading.
I was reading too.
What's the story?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Yes I did...
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
What is it, Mary?
Shut down accelerators.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Dunn.
Sir?
Elaine.
Te...!
It's got to be stopped!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, what's wrong?
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Elaine.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Who's that, Ted?
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Ted!  What are you...?
What are you doing, Ted?
Ted.
Not now, Elaine!
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine, we have to go back.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I'd use the word insane.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Elaine!
Elaine, what's going on?
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Not now, Elaine.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Simon just ejected!
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
That's right -- premature ejection.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Are you afraid?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
Set!
Now!
Ted, the lever!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
I mean for Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Have you got it straightened out now?
I think so.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Simon, what's happening?!
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Can't we change course?
My career is shot.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Maybe.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
Roger.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Negative.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Negative.
That's not possible.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
That's okay, ROK.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Go ahead.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Request; life support systems check.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Scraps.
Can I hold him?
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
I don't want to hear that word!
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
All right.  Here.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
I don't want to live anymore.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
What?
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
What should I say?
Captain Oveur?
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
You can't go in there!
Don't try to stop me!
Are you on the Mercury mission?
Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Then Elaine was right.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
You've been hurt.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
No.  I mean your relationship.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Ah, won't you sit down?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Both pilots!
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
Well...not for another two hours.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
A hospital? What is it?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
No.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Elaine!
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
But if you'll just give me...
Ted, what are you doing here?
What's the matter?
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I love you, Elaine.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Headquarters!? What is it?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
What's his problem?
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
Rain.
And a little ice.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Rats! I've lost number three.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
But Ted, you're the only...
Ted...
Yes?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
See them, Elaine?
We have a visitor.
We'd better get back now.
Airsick?
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Yes, Captain?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
He's right on the heading.
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Oh, I can't stand it.
How ya doing, honey?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
Hi!
I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh, I'd love to.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Yes?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Roger.
Roger.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Excuse me, Sister?
Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
The cockpit? What is it?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
I like my horizons narrow.
You okay?
That's right.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
In there.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
You don't have squat.
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
William Harcourt?
Yes...
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
He didn't recognize me.
When we picked him up, he was talking to those two cops -- the two who came to question you about Hubley.
Kill them both.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Man, somebody really hung one on you!  I've heard some good ones for you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley Davidson.  I guess the people at immigration got a little punchy after a while, coming up with names for a quarter of a million of you. You weren't at the back of the line, were you, George?
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
Let's talk Hubley.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Yes.
What is wrong?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
What's this?  What's going on?
Nothing.
What is this?
Get the picture?
And that fits?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Did you learn anything?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Did you talk to him?
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Why did you do it?
Why'd I do what?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Who said that?
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
But I-- .
Screw you.
Your mother mates out of season.
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
You know that guy?
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
This is mole.  It's good.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Who is he?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Yeah... I know the routine.
You are married?
Was.  Divorced.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
In the other man's rectum.
Your health...
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
I'm going home.
Where'd you get this?!!
She's going to divorce me.
To the... to the beach?
Stop the car.
Why?
Please, I must get out here.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
What was that about?
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
How potent?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
We?  You've taken it?
We all did.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Uh, George...
George, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
Shit!
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
No!  We must do this alone.
What is this?!
... It's Harcourt.
Harcourt is dead.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
We can't let him get away.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
But there's no more drug.
How do I look?
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
What is it?
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Only holds five.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
You think this is the guy who did it?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Who else can I ask around here?
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
That where Anderson worked?
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Ss'kya'ta'.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Yeah, I heard of it.
You know I've been over all this with Fedorchuk and Alterez this morning...
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
The human?
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Yeah.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
What kind of test?
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Yeah, Sykes?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Departmental policy.
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Hope their plumbing's the same.
How can I go?
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
You got your vest?
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Get outta there!
I can't!  Do you mind!
This floor's freezing.
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Position?
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Okay, let's do it.
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Yes.  That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Could it be intelligent?
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
How long until it blows?
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'll go.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
HOW MUCH TIME?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Ripley...
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Have they located my daughter yet?
Is she...?
Amy.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
I get the picture.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
No.  There's no way!
Hear me out...
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
That's right.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
If I go.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
Yello?  Oh, Ripley.  Hi...
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
I hope you're right.  I really do.
That the atmosphere processor?
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Now, wait a second --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Still nothing from the colony?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What's he scanning for?
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
What is it?
I don't know.
So.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
I told them to fall back...
How do you feel?
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Sir?
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
What's the question?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Alive?
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Save it.
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
We got problems.
The corner!  Ready?
Seventeen meters.
Well you're not reading it right!
Let's go!  Let's go!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
All right.  There's a fire door at this end.  The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
They're in the approach corridor.
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
They'll get us.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
What's this?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
It's game time.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Locked.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
Oh, man.  And I was gettin' short, too!  Four more weeks and out. Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin' rock.  It ain't half fair, man!
It's inside the complex.
You're just reading me.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Looks like it stung him.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Thanks.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
They cut the power.
This signal's weird...must be some interference or something. There's movement all over the place...
Range twenty meters.
Fifteen meters.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
Nine meters.  Eight.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
Yeah.  What?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
So what do I tell this guy?
And how are we today?
Terrible.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
What did you say?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
I don't want you for a friend.
Why not?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
They're dead.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Cross my heart.
The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes.  A little girl.
Where is she?
Gone.
Don't go!  Please.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Burke!  Open the door!
Come on.  Crawl faster.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
Mommy...Mommy?
Are we going to sleep now?
That's right.
Look, I told you...
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
How many colonists?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Indeed.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Maestro.
Good morning.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Is there a part for me?
No.
How do you know?
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
In a harem.
What's that?
A brothel.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
What does he look like?
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Did you know? Had you heard?
The marriage!
Well, what does it matter to you?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Don't bother!
What?
Oh - excuse me!
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.
Is she a good fuck?
What??
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
No! I won't have him back.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Hardly.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Sir -
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
And how will you make him keep it?
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
You have leave to try.
Humiliated?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
I want to go!
Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
Why?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
Stop it!
No! No! No!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Why not?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
That's stupid.
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Em iram! Em iram!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Oh, leave me alone.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Yes!
Well, don't do that again!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Don't be stupid.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
No!
Yes!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Wolfi!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
There's a young girl to see you.
What does she want?
I don't know.
Well, ask her!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Stanzi!
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
Wolfi.
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
You're not going to do this?
Why not? Half the house!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Oh, Stanzi.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Who was that?
No one.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
Why not?
No. Don't answer it!
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Give me one reason I can understand.
I can't write it!
Go back to bed.
Excellency!
Frau Mozart?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
He's terribly busy, sir.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Really?
No, sir. This is my own idea.
I see.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Originals?
These are originals?
It is miraculous.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Come back tonight.
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
But! I'm a married woman!
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
What?
What are you doing here?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Why you?
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He asked me to stay.
This is not his handwriting.
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
Leave him alone!
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
He's doing his best.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Money! Money!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
I see that you're expecting.
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Be careful!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I am sorry, Madame, but no! I cannot let anyone pass.
Upstairs.
Gertrude!
Gertrude!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
I said play!
What a strange young man.
Really?
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Just one year.
Who was your teacher?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
What a charming idea. May I see?
May I try it?
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
You do me too much honour, Sire.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
My pleasure.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes?
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Sire.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Why not?
Of course not.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Really?
Yes?
Do you like this, Salieri?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Your Majesty!
Oh, thank you.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Majesty!
Why so?
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
Yes, where?
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
What? On one hearing only?
Yes, indeed.
And German?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
What do you mean, Sire?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Twenty-six.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
What is it?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Yes, Sire.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Ah, love again.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
I have no idea.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
He's here.
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Is she not here?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
How is your financial situation?
It couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
They say you're in debt.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many pupils do you have?
Pupils?
Yes.
How many?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
What's that?
Why not?
It's a secret.
You don't have secrets from me.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
No, really!
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Are you playing a trick on me?
Papa!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
No one calls you that.
Father -
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Good morning, sir.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Yes, thank you, sir.
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Where does he work?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Why? What has happened?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
What medicine?
Where?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Is he working?
Is he working?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Are you Herr Mozart?
That's right.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
What?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Animals?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Wolfi!
Put it down!
What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
No.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Well, we can.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
I'm afraid I am.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
I'm sorry. No.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Really?
Ah!
Love, Sire!
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Whom did they choose?
Herr Sommer.
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
Of course not.
Do you have a daughter?
I'm afraid not.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Ah. Italian?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
What exactly are you working on?
I can't say. Really
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
How fortunate.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
But what is it they don't like?
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
How could I not?
Did my work please you?
How could it not, Excellency?
Yes?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
You flatter me.
I have come to commission work from you.
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
How long will you give me?
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
Are you neglecting my request?
What happened? Is it over?
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Where is your wife?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
No, please.
I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that.
This is only a vaudeville.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Do you mean that?
I do.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Are you ill?
The doctor thinks I am. But -
What?
Shall I answer it?
No! No, it's him!
Who?
The man. He's here.
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Would you? Actually, you could.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Of course.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Where did I stop?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Consigned to flames of woe.
Do you believe in it?
What?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Oh, yes.
Strange!
Confutatis Maledictis.
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
The Fire.
What time?
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
Yes.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
I think so.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
Yes.
It couldn't be simpler.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
Also identical?
And that's all?
Do you have me?
I think so.
That's wonderful!
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
And that's it. Do you have it?
Yes.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I'm not leaving you.
I am so ashamed.
What for?
Oh? Have I seen it?
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
You mean in Turkey?
Exactly.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Exactly. A dance.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
What is what?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
On the contrary.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Mozart -
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Herr Mozart -
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
Mozart -
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
About what?
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
So?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
I do not seek forgiveness.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
How well are you trained in music?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Here in Vienna.
I can't say I do. What is it?
Well?
I regret it is not too familiar.
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Ah - you've heard that?
All Vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Do you hear me?
It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them.
Did you try?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
You cannot say that!
No? Was Mozart a good man?
My son, no one can speak for God.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
What?
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
Yes.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
No, you didn't!
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
What difference does that make?
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Oh my son, my poor son!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
You mean that play?
Exactly.
He's setting that play to music?
Yes.
Are you absolutely sure?
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Incredible.
What anger?
About the ballet.
Ballet? What ballet?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Here I am, my angel.
What? Who the devil are you?
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Well, promise then.
What do you mean - now?
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
I agree, Baron.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
Who is she?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
That lady is back, sir.
What does he want?
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Herr Salieri.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Of course.
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Bene.
I'll call tomorrow.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
How did he look?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.
Oh, Miss Price?
Yes, Doctor?
What exactly did he call out?
He said 'Jack'.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
What happened to them?
Did he say a wolf?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Yes, sir.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
He's not?
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Yes.
What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Warn him?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Yes.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
And what else?
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Surely you're not suggesting...
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Dr. Hirsch?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
What shall we do?
He's here.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Is David acting strangely?
Yes, I should think so.
Yes, Doctor.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
What shall we do?
David?
It wasn't a lunatic.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
Mr. Kessler?
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
How is that?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Aw come on, Alex!
Call me David.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
You're a very beautiful girl.
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
Do you like it?
What do you dream about?
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
What? Oh, yes, please.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Yes, go on.
Hello. You all right?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Will you think about it?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Not just a patient -- me.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Now I'm embarrassed.
I'm a werewolf.
Are you better now?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
My friend Jack was just here.
Your dead friend Jack?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
The kitchen.
Closet.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
There is only one bed.
It's nice to see you.
Yes?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Of course.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
I was awake and he was in my room.
But, David.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Do me an enormous favor?
Anything.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
Okay.
I've left those pills for you.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
The zoo?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Don't you remember?
The next corner we can get a cab.
I should be committed.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
But...
David, what are you doing?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Jack is dead!
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
What?
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
David, don't lose control.
Hello, Benjamin.
No.
No what?
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Feeling better?
No.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
No.
How are we feeling tonight?
No.
No what?
No!
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No.
He all right?
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Chart says he's from New York.
I think he's a Jew.
Why on earth do you say that?
I looked.
Miss Price.
Has he been refusing food?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
All right, you two, move along.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
There's no call for that kind of language.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Who is this girl?
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
Oh, come on, tell us.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
What time is it?
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Alex?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
What are you going to see?
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Some, everyone does.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Where am I?
You're in a hospital in London.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
Two weeks?
Lunatic?
There were witnesses?
So they said.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
You've never had bad dreams before?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Yes.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Did you see Jack?
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
I really don't know.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Are you cold?
Yes.
Jack.
David.
You're not having a good time are you?
Well, I like it here.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
She's a jerk.
You're talking about the woman I love.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
I don't know.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
The Slaughtered Lamb?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
I assume full responsibility.
Okay.
Hello.
Nice looking group.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
What about it?
Ask them what the candles are for.
You ask them.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Right.
Go on, ask them.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
What the hell was that all about?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Beware the moon?
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
I have no idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Say, David...
Did you hear that?
I heard that.
Could be a lot of things.
Yeah?
A coyote.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Shit! David, what is that?
Come on, where?
It's moving.
What's the plan?
Plan?
It's in front of us.
Oh shit. What is that?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Walk away, Jack.
See anything?
It sounds far away.
Jack?
Yeah.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Nice to see you.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I can't stand it.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
David!
What?!
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
I'm not listening!
Shut up, you zombie!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Stop it, Jack.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
Nurse!
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Nurse!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
You're not real.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Yes.
Get out of here, Jack!
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
A monster. I know, I know.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
Jack, are you really dead?
What do you think?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
You must believe me.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
Hi, Jack.
What can I say, Jack?
You don't have to say anything.
You look awful.
Thank you.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
What about the zoo?
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Hello.
Because this must be stopped.
I could hang myself.
Dr. Hirsch?
You were saying?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
What can we do to assist you?
Yes?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Excuse me.  Yes?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
What's that?
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
Do you have any hot soup?
Hot chocolate?
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
Then you have some hot tea?
No.
Oh.
Remember the Alamo?
No, thank you.
Sorry.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
And what, Sergeant?
I don't rightly know, sir.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
Hello, Tom.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest�
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Yes - sure�
Oscar, what's the matter?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
No kidding?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Where's Matt?
Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
He has?
How much?
About twenty-four thousand.
It was more than that last week.
Yeah.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Charlie!
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I�
Whose death?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Where you been?
What's the matter, Charlie?
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
I remember once when your account checked.
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust�
What good will that do?
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
Say, you know, I found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. You've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything�
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
We want to talk to you.
What about?
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
What do you mean, help?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Say, you can't do that�
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Oh!
You understand?
Thanks.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Fifty thousand dollars!
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't�
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
I'm sorry, Dude, but�I�
That don't do us any good.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I�
Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
What do you mean?
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
know, but�
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Me?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Well, you can. You always could.
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks�
�running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Line?
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Well�
Well, what?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Why are you so anxious?
Don't you know?
No.
What?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Why, Cyril, you're insane�
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer�
What's this?
My apartment.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals�  I think I will have a drink.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Now?
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
I'm listening.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
I'm not interested in what you think.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
Phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  You'd do well to mind your own business.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Excuse me�
I'm feeling fine this morning.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Shall we let the people come in?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
The theatre?
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, of course.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn�
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Well . . .
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
Happy now?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Good morning.
I don't know.
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Why - well, I�
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Longer.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Good morning, Helen.
Good morning.
Oh!
Yes?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Yes?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Helen!
Yes?
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Mr. Dickson?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Yes, sir.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
It's all right. Thanks.
What's the matter? You don't seem very excited about it.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Well, I�
I already told him I was home.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
No. I won't.
You're protecting somebody.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is�
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and�
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
But I haven't . . .
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
If he can do it, yes.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
You're lying!
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
The lobby's half filled now.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
What'll we do?
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Is it safe?
Absolutely.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
I'm afraid so.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
No.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
Hello, Helen!
Matt, come here!
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
What did you do with it?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars�
Yes.
Yes.
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Well . . . ?
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
In Cluett's office?
What's keeping you?
Oh, Charlie again.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Oh now, don't be silly.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Oh, Matt . . .
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
They must have turned him down.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Did you talk to him?
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Mr. Williams . . .
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Did you say Dude Finlay?
He was in the bank yesterday.
He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Are you sure?
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Dude Finlay?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
�for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
What time was it?
Huh?
Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after�
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
No. It wasn't earlier because...
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it�
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
wasn't anywhere near this place�
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Then who changed it?
So you were home last night?
Yes.
What time did you get in?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
How are you fixed?
I'm okay, Matt.
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Everybody in?
I guess so.
Where's Charlie?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
You can ride like that?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
I couldn't lose him.
This is healing?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
He's smiling.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
Uhh, yeah it does.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
How?
We got a problem here, brother?
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
This is the best score yet.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
How'd they --
What have you done?
I ain't done --
Bob. I didn't...
Swear.
I swear --
I'm sorry, Cole.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
He's not bad at it.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Yesterday.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Nope.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
Oh no...
Damn!
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
The Army can hang him.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
How many of them did he kill?
But if we take their money and supplies...
All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Hey!
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
Beg pardon?
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
You are a fine figure of a man.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
He's planning a job.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
What?
What you sayin' boy?
I think I recognize you.
How?
You shut up now, boy.
Ride with me, cousin?
I could use the walk.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
You're not scared, are you?
Not now.
What is wrong with you?
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She had a moustache.
She was European!
Thanks for the help.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
It was exciting.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
So what do we do, General Lee?
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
Perfect, Cole.
The James-Younger Gang.
Sorry.
I got seven thousand.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
It's not a bank.
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
Jesse, we got to have a word.
Sure, cousin.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Yep.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Beautiful.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
A bad idea.
I got us through the War all right.
I'm the better soldier, Jesse.
Still smells fishy.
Fine. We hit this bank.
Dammit!
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
We'll make them pay for this.
I'm out.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Missed you, cousin.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Well?
Cannon or Gatling?
Both would be nice.
What the --
I think one of 'em's glass.
Which one, right or left?
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Strategically.
Jesse.
Another dozen out back.
They gonna rush us?
The safe. Now.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
You 'um big lawman?
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Of St. Louis?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Then why can't I go in there?
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
It's a secret.
What is it?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
So?
Where the hell were you?
I had you covered.  From back there.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
My little Web did that?
Web died fighting?
What do you say, sir?
You know you're welcome any time!
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Daddy, don't start with this again.
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
They're gone. What are you --
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
He thinks this is some kind of game!
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Distracting enough for you?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Mm-hmm.
Such as?
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
That would have made an impression.
I figure.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Web's dead.
I reckoned.
Hell of a war.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
You're doing just fine.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
That just might work.
"Big and older"?
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
She's still talking to Jesus.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You know him?
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Don't care.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
How'd it go in there?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
This has been a good year.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
And we're good at it.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
You've killed your fair share of men.
If I could go back to farming --
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
We're doing this for Ma.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
We're drunk.
Oh yeah.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Jim was old enough...
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Yeah.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Yeah, Jimmy?
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Can't argue that.
So what was he?
Uncle Frank?
Yeah Jimmy?
How much of that story is true?
A fair number, Ma.
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Easterners.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Ma! Please!
Riders --
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But still died.
Jesse, are you awake?
Jesse, is that your hand?
You shouldn't be up.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
You're sick of my company?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
What?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
You didn't want to farm?
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
A river pirate.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
And what's this right girl like?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Where will you find such a girl?
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Little ones.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Yep.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
I am so sorry, Jesse.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Me neither.
Let the law --
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Zee.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
I don't understand.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
"Hmm" what?
I beg your pardon?
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Stop it. This is just sad.
Don't turn around.
What?
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Yes ma'am.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
You are a hell of a woman.
Don't swear.
Tennessee?
We're moving you tomorrow.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Did you order our houses burned down?
You almost ended my career before it began.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Last February?
Mmm.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
Yes?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
I figured.
Was it worth it?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
I'm not hanged yet.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
Thanks.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Thank you.
Now let's have a drink.
Right here in church?
And you're too young.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
I like that.
You okay, Jesse?
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I guess so.
Well, not exactly.
You been with a girl ever?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
I think so.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
I swear.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
... too young for whisky...
This time we'll make an exception.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Why, yeah.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Really?
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Lyla Devereux.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Really?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
They had to be dealt with!
How can that be?
There's only four of them...
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Really!
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Good.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Yes sir.
Just perfect.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
How much did they get from the safe?
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
THEN WHO DID?!
Your men knew the risks.
With my money!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Parker.
Sir?
What is that?
That.
This is him.
How did you know?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
You wouldn't have done that?
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
I want them arrested and hanged!
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
This is no game.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
It is a nice piece of writing.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
So you can't tell me anything?
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
I demand action.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
Can't you tell me anything?
So he's won.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
In English, Pinkerton.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Can you put men at all four?
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
What is that?
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Stop it. I'm...
On a lot of lithium?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Pumpkin?
Yes?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Uh huh.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
I know. Stop it.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Nice?
You like it there, don't you?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Eight?
Pick me up?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
J&B. Straight.
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Are we here?
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Luis is a despicable twit.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Is it a what?
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
It's a plain end. I think.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Take it off.
Why?
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
What are you doing tonight?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
You and...Luis?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
I never knew you smoked.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Patrick?
Yes?
I haven't seen you around here.
You just haven't been looking.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Nothing like last time, promise.
So, you're looking great, how have you been?
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Really?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Do...what.
Evelyn?
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
No-I can't take the time off work.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Why don t you just go for Price?
He's rich.
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
I want a firm commitment.
Why? What's wrong?
We need to talk.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
You're really serious, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
No, no, no.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Where are you going?
I'm just leaving.
But where?
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Good coloring.
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
Because he dated her.
How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Listen, what about dinner?
Are you my two o'clock?
Can I help you?
Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Yes, naturally.
What exactly do you mean?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Carnes? Wait.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
No, you...didn't?
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
Lucky, I guess.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Uh huh.
It looks so soft.
Patrick? Is that you?
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Call me please, Patrick.
What...is...it?
Where are you going?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Patrick?
That's Paul Owen.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Maybe it's just the light.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
What?
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
SHUT UP!
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
Like what?
What's that, a gram?
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Don't, I'll drink it.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Dorsia.
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
Dorsia, yes?
We are totally booked.
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
When?
After six.
Oh? And what should I say?
Just...say...no.
Oh, something. . romantic?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I'll do it.
Yes?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
You don't like this, I take it?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
What is it?
Patrick?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Who?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Yes, Patrick?
Jean?
Yes, Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
You didn't give them a name.
Jean? Sorbet?
Want a bite?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, not really.
Interesting.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Forget it.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
Sorry.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Where are you?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
...to the office this afternoon.
Why?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
So, what do you do?
What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well...
Welt...it depends, why?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
No. I really don't.
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Well.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Next Saturday?
Yeah.
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin�e of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
She's my...cousin.
Uh huh?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Don't tell him you're here.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Who?
Paul Owen.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
No.
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Coffee?
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
KIMBALL.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Understandable.  Lime?
No, really. I'm okay.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Shoot.
How old are you?
Where did you go to school?
Your address?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Who do you ask?
Bad habit.
Would you rather I not smoke?
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
How well did you know him?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Yeah...Yale thing.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
No. Not really.
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
Don't you know this?
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Well, maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Actually, yes.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
What?
Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
No.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
That's so typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Nothing.
People just...disappear.
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?"
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
I mean they want to get caught.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
What?
That's not the information I've received.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Well, I could he wrong.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
Not a big music fan, eh?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
No hash browns?
Not in the mood, I guess.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I've questioned him.
Marcus?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
But Marcus denied it?
Yes.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
He does? You're sure?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
I'm so hungry.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I lost my job...
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
I'm not...
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I'm hungry
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
What am I gonna do?
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Al.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
It's...it's...all right.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Cecelia is, well...you know
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Hey, Halberstam?
Yes, Owen?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Is that a raincoat?
You think so?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
Is it over?
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
You are a fanatic.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
"Make" him?
I'm just screwed.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
You don't wanna move, do you?
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
I think I kind of lost it. I was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest, most powerful... 'Didn't know I even cared about that stuff.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
It's important.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
...But?
Didn't you visit the campus?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
That took some fun out of --
You know he's never been anybody's counselor before?
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
I know, I know.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Isn't that -- extreme?
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
What!
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
Milo. Why would he --
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
I can't just walk away!
You can't just walk in, either.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
...Whaddo I do?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
Nothing.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
...Why?
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
I remember.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Guilt?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
That was -- different.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Look at this.
What?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Milo --
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
Great!
You look beautiful.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
...What?
Milo?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Here we go.
...wanna savor this.
It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.
'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
No.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
He'll tell me when he gets home.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich� about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
He wasn't acting?
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Right... What's that mean again?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Milo?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
Milo?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
Will I get to work for Outpost?
What?
Okay.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
What?!
You're interfaced with our dish.
Is it your software?
What?!
...When did you know?
That's gotta kill him, right?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
We tried!
Milo? I'm Danny.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
He's pretty tight with his family.
We could move 'em up here.
Who's that?
...Hello?
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Cool!
Would you like a Coke or something?
You know a lot about art, I guess.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
I do!
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
'Think I should buy some originals?
...Do I?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
How's it going?
Maybe I'm going too fast.
It's okay. Really.
You did this -- overnight?
Milo. What's up?
Well -- you sent for me.
You really wrote this just today?
What're you implying.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
I'm sure.
It scales, don't you think?
I heard what happened.
Had you talked to him much lately?
Did you?
Talk about work? Never!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Oh. Yeah.
You've been coming in early.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
The wrong place?
Gary, hi.
You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
...Worse?
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
That's great! Thanks.
You could've handwritten it.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Gary, I --
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
This is good. Who did it?
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
What'd the girl say?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Okay, #2.
Ready for number three?
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
What?
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
I think you should go.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Just thought his work should go on.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
...You wanna work -- here?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Every entry was authorized.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
Lisa.
You know mine.
You're famous around here.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
...Were you?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
...Something like that. Yeah.
Did I say something?
What've you got there?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Cool!
Did you wanna be alone?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
You're compulsive.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why's that?
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
That's great. I -- didn't know.
I snuck into #21.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
But why would they --?
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
...Milo?
What about the FBI?
Who can we trust?
Do we post it on the Net?
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
He's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies, baby bells, picture libraries, museum rights, film archives... Getting ready for Skywire.
What about "60 Minutes."
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
Time?
What?
A what?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
You mean -- break in?
I don't know --
Why were you snooping in my office?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Oh.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
Does he know you know?
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Why?!
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Please don't go.
Meet me at the other location.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Bring it to the other location.
Maybe it's the satellite.
...He knows.
What?
Latitude 47 degrees.
...You got my E-mail?
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Is that how Larry feels?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
I met this girl.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
Did you tell Alice?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
What d'you mean?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
What does that mean?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
So how'd you like the house?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
She's a programmer?
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
What're they building?
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Speaking of which...
Did you download Corey? In San Jose?
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
What is it?
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
That kid's the great white hope.
I could get it out of him.
Who're these guys?
Where is he?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
You seem surprised to see me.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
You may.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Come in.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
To my health.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Is it about my teeth?
Yes.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Hey, how are you?
Hungry.
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
We know all that, Exposition.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Where am I?
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
Be careful.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Right away, Exposition.
She's working on another lead right now.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Thank you, Basil.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Yes?
Be careful.
Hello, Exposition.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
What's the other?
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Carnies.
What?
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Yes, Basil?
Be careful.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Yes Basil?
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Hey, Mick!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Well, you can't always get what you want.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Good on ya, man.
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Why not? It's a question.
What's wrong with your hand?
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
My mother's told me all about you.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
I beg your pardon?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Excuse me?
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
My meat and two veg.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
A Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Do I make you horny?
What?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
I'm sure.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Here, use mine.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Why did you leave so soon?
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Why?
A limousine has just pulled up.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
How do you know?
He's too well-protected right now.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I don't get it.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
I hate having my picture taken.
Fancy a nibble?
I haven't had fun like that since college.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Oh, yes you are.
I can't. You're drunk.
Really, Austin!
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Of course, luv.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Not in the Nineties.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Hello, luv.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Who?
You know who.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
All right, I get it. I have bad teeth. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Indeed.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Yes.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Shut up.
What do we do now?
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
I'll hurry back.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Austin, what's your point?
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
Likewise.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Are you crazy?
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Lay it on me.
I love you, Austin.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Kiss me.
Danger Powers, personal effects.
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
That's not mine.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Everything seems to be in order.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Don't mind if I do.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Noooooooooooooo!
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
Is it one of ours?
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
What are you saying, son?
Oh my God, he's back.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Shut up.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Commander, I have to log it...
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Ahhhhhhhhh!
We've got a lot of work to do.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Ow! You shot me!
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Yes.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
My son?
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Quite impressive.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Dr. Evil?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
They're mutated sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
An evil vet?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
An evil petting zoo?
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
I don't want to.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
What did you say?
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did have an affair. He admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.
Umm, that also has already happened.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
Great.
He's asleep.
You didn't...
I'm proud of you.
Why?
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
What about his teeth?
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
I just don't see it.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Did you ever...
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Did you ever want to?
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
We don't judge here.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
And how do you feel about that?
What do you want to do, Scott?
We don't label people here, Scott.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Really?
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Seriously?
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
There are limits?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
... bottle ...
Red ...
Knight ...
Black...
... death ...
Love...
Flower ...
Nature ...
... preserve...
Secret ...
... love...
Hope...
... love ...
Fear ...
... love ...
How long have I been here?
Would that I could say the Same.
I've come to apply for membership in Brolly --
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
You
Have we met?
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Promised? Who promised?
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
May I help you, madam ...
Mr. John Steed, please.
You are female?
As you see.
Then you can't come in.
I have an appointment.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
Quite a collection.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
This isn't a game.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
People, too.
Then who wins?
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
Hmmm ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
How curious ...
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
I resign.
We want to help...!
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
The Institute ... the funding ...
Who?
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
To find out who killed my husband.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
An unholy trinity ...
You killed my husband.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Too many cooks --
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
But -- why?
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
I'm already married ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
Valentine, listen to me ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ...
You're mad.
Such as?
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
The result would be ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
Then what's stopping you?
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
What are my choices?
Choices?
Doctor Peel, I presume?
I was about to throw in the towel.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
1922. Why the kippers?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Whereas you are.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
And just what is the game?
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Much better.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
I didn't. Mother did.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
My father always wanted a boy.
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
I thought we were on our way.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Steed, we really must be --
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
But why? What's the point?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
And I suppose you're the knight.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
As per mother's instructions.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
No thanks.
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Any other vices?
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Strange.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
I wasn't about to.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Did he say who?
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
I must say, you look more your old self --
You mean my other self ...
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
What on earth?
Any ideas?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
But
Not quite. This is my field.
Is there anything that isn't?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Is that what you think?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Barely.
This must be the last straw.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Steed ... !
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
Was I?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Orders.
To kill me?
I could save you the trouble.
No trouble.
Yes ... ?
And do you trust me?
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
But you did suspect me.
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
Winning isn't everything.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
No, after you.
You don't trust me?
I told Mother I took care of you.
You lied.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
No idea who. No idea why ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
Aren't you coming?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
What's that you're wearing?
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
Trubshaw again? What now?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
I'll be back ...
Where are you going?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
What kept you?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Have you any place in mind?
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Our chaperon.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Where's Mother?
You don't believe him?
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Decontamination -- ?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
I see.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Peter's brother?  But --
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Surveillance? By whom?
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Who's now vanished.
Makes two of us.
I was getting to it.
Getting to what?
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Privately owned by ...
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
Global warming?
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Oh, hello ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Steed
How did you guess?
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Weather's turning nasty.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Think she really killed those agents?
Amnesia?
Possibly. Split personality ...
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Why?
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
Anyone particular in mind?
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
This man -- did you see him?
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
I was hoping you could tell me.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Where?
In your operation.
Are you alright, young man?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
I feel sure of it.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
You with Mother or Father?
Both, actually.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
John Steed.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
The last one you'll ever see.
You're better than I expected.
I was at Harrow ...
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
One shot -- for emergencies.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
You said ... one shot.
Aren't you forgetting about something?
You are, and it's behind you.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
What's happening?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Does Cole know about this?
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
What do you mean?
You're kidding.
That's what we're going to find out...
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
What?
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
I've decided not to run for President.
Man, you're losing your audience.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
And...
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
I want Debbie.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Seventy-five hundred.
Not interested.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm marrying Debbie.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
I don't want any trouble.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
Great car.
The best.
The car for Debbie?
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Maybe it had something to do.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Hello?
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes I did.
Fine. How's everything going?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Thank you, sir.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Yes, sir, I am.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
I've tried to change her mind.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
But how can I do that?
Thanks for the advise, sir.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
1002.
Cole?
Cole, we've got to talk.
No, Cole, I...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
I'm going now, Cole.
God, you're a slob.
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
It looks awful.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Huh? Wha...
I can't sleep.
What's the matter?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
About what?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
That feels so great.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
You better not have too much joy.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Your mother's not dead.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I can't trust you!
Let go of me!
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Yes...
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Let's get naked.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Ilene, are you crazy?
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
A strange wang right in my palm.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
A real turd.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
That's it, prick lips.
What are you...
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Why?
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Give him the works.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Let's go.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
It's true.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Hookers beat you up?
Yes.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
What can I be doing for you?
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I'll take some.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
So, Larry, how have you been?
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Is that all the coke in the place?
That's it.
You want to share it?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
I just want to be alone.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
You okay?
Yeah, I guess so.
Really?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Ha, ha, ha.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
Are any of those right?
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
It's on the tenth floor.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Oops!
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
I'd love that.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Feel free.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Rick!
The end.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Ed... you're kinky!
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
Where the hell is he?
What's the matter?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Olivier's in that, right?
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
I'm not really hungry.
What the hell is that?
My gift to you.
Under the table!
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Rick, I'm concerned.
About what?
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Right in there, pal.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Who was that?
I don't know.
What's this?
How 'bout this?
He look familiar?
Very.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Hey, you guys...
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
What are you going to do about it?
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
Reach out and snort someone.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Who?
Debbie.
My Debbie?
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
You're late again, Rick.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
I don't know.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Oh these moments do try me...
Wash it to the windows?
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
You know Knowlton pretty well?
Yeah...
Biggest in two battalions.
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
-- Knock it off!
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
Did you do it for Tim?
Just come down, John. Just --
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Who asked you?
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Not likely.
I like what you've done with the place.
Been ripping off fire stations?
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
Why'd you come here, Brian?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Goddamn it Stephen!
-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Thanks.
Hey.
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
This?
Roll the hose.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
Ready?
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
You okay?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
...Not now, Brian.
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
You're selling dad's boat?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
It's okay, Stephen, I --
I saw it.
Saw what?
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Everybody did.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
-- What are you doing here?
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I know.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
Anything else?
What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Brian.
Jennifer.
You're back.
You look great.
Thanks for calling.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Huh.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
Really? No kidding.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
With grenadine, right?
When I was twenty.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Arson.
Hey.
How's it going?
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
I could use a date.
Hi.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
You think that's really any of your business?
Okay.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Got anything to drink in there?
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Homey.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Then why did you quit?
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Brian. What's wrong?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Leave Stephen out of this --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
-- I work for the city.
Hi.
Hi.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Yes.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What is --
I'm sorry.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
What'll you do?
I don't have the slightest idea...
I'll see ya around, huh?
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Who's doing this?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Then who --
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
I don't have a story.
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
What?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
The outlets.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Trychticholorate.
Who the fuck is doing this?
Oh Jesus Christ...
I want another shot, Sir.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
I need another one, sir.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Are you still here?
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
-- Shhh.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
Glass?
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
And the putty around the door?
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
But the right guess on this is arson.
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
What?
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.
But he killed these guys.
What reason?
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Are you going public with this?
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Nice bunch of guys.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Then who wrote the report?
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
Did you pull me out?
Yeah.
Did I say thanks?
No.
Just wondering.
So what do you want me to do?
Your brother was a good man.
Yeah.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Four months.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Yeah. Big fan.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No need to be modest, Brian.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
I have a job.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Nice boat.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Completely out of control.
Aren't you even curious?
Engine 115, right?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Do you have to do that?
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
What?
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
Well, if it isn't the littlest McCaffrey.  Hey! You break anything with that you buy it!  Sorry, there must be something wrong with my eyes. I keep thinking that's a fire department uniform.
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Management were pin heads.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Coffee sucked.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
I was ahead of my time.
Who's going to die?
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
Fireman shit?
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Firehouse.
Dad!
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
I'm busy.
They're waitin' man.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Fixing my roof.
Where's Sean?
He's got piano lessons.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's going to be a fireman.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
-- You remember.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
The great communicator.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
He treats you okay?
Okay.
I treated you better.
You want some coffee?
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
He's out.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Yeah? When was the last time?
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
What's wrong?
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
Look, I'm sorry I --
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
Putty? On both doors?
Anyway, down here, take a look...
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Shadow.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
He works for me.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
Knock it off. Now.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Did he tell you how we finally met?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
-- Burn them.
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
And the world -- the whole world.
Got a cause?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
I'm working on it.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
It knows us. This one knows us.
Alderman Swayzak.
Investigator Rimgale.
Inspector.
"Don?"
Don't you have any leads at all?
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
I'm a little busy right now --
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
What's to believe?
People.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Yeah.
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
Yeah.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
Nah...
Who?
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
"The Strawberries"?
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
You took the chalice.
Yes.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
Are you all right, honey?
So what are you doing here?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
How are you doing, man?
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I forgive you.
Me?
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Large?
All right, cop. I want my money.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Let me think about it.
Oh, really?
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
All right. What are you gonna do?
I want 15 on the Mets.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
Are you sure?
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
Do you have the money?
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
This psycho can.
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
How's the case going?
What case?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
Yes, Sister?
Those boys, those sad, raging boys... They came to me as the needy do. And like many of the needy, they were rude. Like all the needy, they took. And like all the needy, they needed.  Father. I knew them; They learn in our school. And play in our schoolyard. And they are good boys.
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Keep trying.
...Benedict Arnold...
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Everybody say Ho!
Ho!
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
Yeah!
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
YEAH!
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Let's go niggers!
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
Well you did.
Give me some?
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
Who are you revolting against?
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Please.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
Delacroix.
Yeah, him.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
You don't have the demographics.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
What's your name?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
We're ready when you are.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
What do I do?
What do you do?
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
You might be right.
I'm not smiling.
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
What's that?
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
What's wrong with him?
Please, have a seat.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
What are you talkin' about?
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Meaning?
I'm out.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
So that's what you been doing?
Damn skippy.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Good morning, Cheeba.
De-la-croix.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
No offense.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
How much?
What kind of show is this gonna be?
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Nice to meet you.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
And I'm the feet.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
We was coming to see you.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
That ain't funny.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
My tap shoes.
What do I have to do?
Some tap dancing, some singing.
How different?
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I would like to change your name.
To what?
You're now Mantan.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Why?
Mantan?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
How you sound?
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
But the line has to be drawn.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
Four minutes ago.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
I'm wid it.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Go on.  Good so far.
Word!!!
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
The name of the show?
I'm feelin' dis'!
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
That's a great handle.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
What are there character traits?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Exactly!
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.
Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
Who are the other characters?
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
This has to be a big mistake.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
What do you want?
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
How did you end up here?
That's what I'm askin'.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Where do you go from here?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I didn't mean that, in life.
Let's get him over to the bed.
I love you too, Daddy.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
How long has my father been like this?
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
So what's up with you?
How was it?
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Manray!
How did you know?
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
Do you know how you will use him?
You lost me.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Sounds risky to me.
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Hello.
You okay?
What is your problem?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
This is the group I was telling you about.
Which one is your brother?
Just want to say good luck.
Your life will never be the same.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
We both lied to him.
What do you want me to say?
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
Who's side are you on?
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
So you have your small victory, now what?
What is this?
A gift.
For what?
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
I thought it was appropiate.
Is that good or bad?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
How so?
Why'd you do that?
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Please don't go there.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
This is crazy.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Don't make me have to use this.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
Yes, your name?
Hi, Mona.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
Can I kiss you too?
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
I feel fine.
So they can be on TV.
You sound like the media.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Same thing Giuliani said.
No joke.  Serious.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
No.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
Yeah.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
What you did is dead wrong.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I don't believe it.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
It looks delicious.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
How's the food?
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Peerless, your father called.
He wants you to come and see him.
He said that?
Yes he did.
Where is he?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
Regardless, he still is your father.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
No.
Not at all?
You know how your Daddy is.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Where are you from?
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
How did you get this gig?
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
Let Myrna finish.
Yes you!
I never had a really real pair before.
You've never had any formal training, either?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
You sing and dance?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
What do you mean?
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Money and nothing else?
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
...the big apple, New York, New York.
To come back to our roots.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
You tellin' the truth.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
The one with da big...
Not her, the one with the little...
No, not that.  How 'bout...
She hates dem.
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
I thought you got rid of...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
I heard ya lady is wild.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...no, she didn't...
...yes she did.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...not that time...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
Around...
...too early...
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...perfect...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
...like macaroni and cheese...
...like grits and butter...
I fell out of my bed last night.
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
I don't know who I am.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
I feel a song a comin' on.
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
A lot?
So what's up with you?
What do you want to know?
The good stuff.
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
What else?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Oh you do, huh?
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
No, before my time.
You don't read, do you?
Maybe you need to start.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Why don't you call him?
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
Y'know what?
What?
How did you get this gig?
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
You leave something out?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
And?
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Aw, c'mon.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
Good day to you, young sir.
Good morning.
Where are you bound for?
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Both of us ride home with Best here.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
What is your uncle's name?
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
I have acted as I think fit.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
What is the service, sir?
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
And his baggage?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
And so I am.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
Have you taken my message to him?
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
I'll match any man with the sword.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
The coward!
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I don't know.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Good gracious!  What is this?
You are going to drive to the frontier.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Your honor must lower his voice.
I have no luggage.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Yes, sir.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
Who else can give me information about you?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
I believe they will deport you.
I have faced that problem before.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Certain?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Then you yield to me.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
That is a trifle strong.
No.
Have you had one?
Never.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not even that.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Not one.
Have you not a man whom you value?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
How so?
You want my heart?
It is my only object.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
Agreed.
I feel the ribbon.
Why are you shaking?
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
All the same, you must name an amount.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
By name only.
Yes!
Does this assignment interest you?
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
May I be quite frank with you?
Yes, of course.
I see.
Did you buy the horse, papa?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Good night, my little darling.
Papa?
Yes?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Is he all right, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
The milkmaid's daughter?
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
I beg your pardon?
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
And he doesn't care about me?
He is only curious to know who you are.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
He loves me, as I love you.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
Can I at least have a drink?
Yeah, if you've slept.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Bill Styles...
Who?
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
What do we do?
I don't want to go --
Did -- did you --
What about Pike?
He is the only one unaccounted for.
You framed-him...
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
You killed him you fucking faggot --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
West was one thing, but this --
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
Yeah, right...
You too?
Why not?
I asked for a policeman.
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
It's... too slow.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I just don't like it.
I don't know... I like the Army.
You did Basic here?
There's no need...
Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
I'm not telling you what happened.
Some.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
You smoke, Ray?
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
I didn't shoot West --
I apologize --
And he'd been shot.
You shot Childs and Nunez.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
You saved Kendall's life --
Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story --
We're not finished yet --
We don't need the tapes --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
He -- He made me do it --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
And the bodies?
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
Epilepsy.
He said he worked there --
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
What business?
Where?
Back up.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Where's the cabin?
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
How do you know that?
Cadet, what's your name!
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?
Sir, yes, sir!
What the fuck is going on?
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Why?
Jesus, what happened?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
So you killed him?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
What do you mean, West's?
Where have you been, Jay?
You know it's not like that --
Right?
You gotta untie me.  I didn't do this thing, Ray.
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
If not you, then who?
Mueller.
Oh, come on --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
That's exactly what he says about you.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Look in my pack.
Why?
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
You're lying --
Why... why didn't you tell me?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
They?
I... I don't know...
What don't you know?
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
But not the only victim, right?
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
What happened to "degrees"?
I didn't kill him --
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
He admitted it.
Why did he come back for you?
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Is it the truth?
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Well?
Dunbar will testify that you were.
Something funny, Levi?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Why?
How do you know?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
I didn't --
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
I don't know --
Where are they!
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
How are you?
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
That bad?
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
And the problem is you only got three.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Nevertheless --
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
You mean not enough to save you.
Tom, where are you going --
Home, I'm done.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
What I said before --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Yeah.
It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
That's horseshit and you know it.
You think you could explain all this to me?
They're taking your command, aren't they?
I'm sorry, Bill.
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
What are you talking about?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You're drunk --
Stay where you are.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
That's preposterous --
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
I wanted to see if he was okay --
I'm not even going to dignify that --
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
You're crazy --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Hostile and uncooperative.
Ah, Christ
You knew Sergeant West?
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
You and the Colonel go back.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
Move him.
Why?
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Excuse me?
Is Dunbar cute?
That is the most unprofessional --
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
Good cop/bad cop?
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
Baseball?
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You made me look like an idiot --
You're right. We should sit in silence.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
What is that?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Something like that. You?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
The very same.
I plan to grow on you.
You're off to a late start.
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
Something wrong?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Watch me.
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
Why do you care?
What?
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
Dunbar.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Buttfucks the cabin?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
That bugs you too?
Little bit.
We're fucked, I know --
They got their stories straight.
What?
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
Are you sure?
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
That's a fantastic idea --
I pushed him too hard.
You couldn't have known --
You wanted to get the truth.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
You wanted to break him.
So what now?
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
For what?
We were close to something with Kendall.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
No.
Hardy, what are you doing --
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
No bodies, no West...
We need to talk --
What?
This isn't the time --
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
What if I don't want it?
That's not true.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
You're a good man, Hardy.
West?
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Nah.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
I should probably write that down.
Your phone number?
He was your friend.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
How?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
I don't think I want to hear this --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
We should tell him we're not going.
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Poor fucker my ass...
Pike and I got separated --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Oh, you remember now --
I was freezing from the hurricane --
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
He said what?
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
But you didn't see it, right?
Pike never confessed.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Fifty minutes.
Pike never confessed.
Dunbar says you were.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
Wait --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Wrong answer --
Who, Levi --
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
What happened with Nunez?
What the fuck happened to you --
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
Thank God...
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
I used it to start the fire --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
The fuck are you talking about --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
Bullshit --
Tell him to shut up --
Yeah.
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
This is totally unnecessary --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He's not Army, it's not official --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You think he did it?
What do you think?
You want Kendall, don't you?
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
We know.
What happens to Dunbar now?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Sir, yes, sir!
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
See! The big guy likes it.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Yes!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Who is she? Where does she live?
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Someone stole my backpack.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
Thank you.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
Bloom like a flower?
Yes.
You were expecting me?
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
I have to leave. Tonight.
Why?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
You won't find a better place!
Or are you too scared?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Then do it.
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
You get the eye?
Bloom!
Don.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Can I see him?
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
How long have you known my father?
How would you describe him?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
No.
What did she look like?
Well, she... uh...
Yeah.
How old are you?
Eighteen.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
Promise me you'll come back.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
So I've heard.
In so many words, yes.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
Helping people makes me happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
It's okay, just leave it.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
I'll...
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
I know.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Lucky girl.
Really.
I was dreaming.
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
That's terrible.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
No, I understand.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
Stop.
Spooning the sherbet.
Can I take your picture?
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
I never knew.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
There was one time when I was eleven...
You were talking about your wedding.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
I like your stories.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
I can.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
What's your name, Giant?
Karl.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
You don't like it?
Okay.
What did she say?
You're not trying to run away?
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
The one about the witch.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
Did you do any of that?
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
You think I'm up for it?
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
Really.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
So how does it happen?
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
Okay.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
What did he say?
You owe me three-fifty.
When did you ever work in an office?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
You mean, while I'm here.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
I will.
I thought you weren't dying.
Why not religion, Dad?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Did I ever tell you about how...
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
Dad?
Son?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
What?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
You think I'm fake.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
The river.
Tell me how it happens.
How what happens?
Like this.
Where are we headed?
You say...
It's unbelievable.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
Daffodils?
They're your favorite flower.
How did you get so many?
You don't even know me.
How can I convince you to stop?
I was drying out.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
Really.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
So what are you up to now?
This is it? The whole vault.
'Fraid so.
Oh. Oh.
Hello.
Are you Jenny Hill?
How did you know my father?
Were you and my father having an affair?
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
You didn't become crazy.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
Yes.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'm going to check on him.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
Do you like it, being pregnant?
I do.
It's bad.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You need to go.
You don't have to.
I talked with your father last night.
You never told me how your parents met.
They met at Auburn.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
That's because most of it never happened.
Mmm, what?
Do you love your father?
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
But it's not true.
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
You're not.
What happened?
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
How did you get here?
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
We rented a car.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How is he?
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
How much time does he have left?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Of course.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Yes.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Yes. But that's a different...
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Was she one of your teachers?
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
That really happened?
Is he awake?
Mom?
Did you and Dad have any other property?
So you never bought any land.
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
What for?
No I don't.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Yeah it was okay.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were good.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
It's enough isn't it?
What do you mean?
Do you want to stop?
Yes.
What's this?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.
Do you like it?
Say thank you.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
What? What are you doing?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
Leave him!
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
Ch...
Right.
You can see why it's sensitive?
Hello.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
Sorry. You've lost me...
I'm asking what you're here for.
What did he say?
I need to know who you are first please.
Oh.  We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
Good.
And...
Hold on.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Right.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Right.
So?
What was that?
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
So how long will you be in England?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Uh. Do you like England?
She says she has a secret to tell.
When?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
I...
Binoculars.
What was that?
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me what he said.
No. It's not that.
Do you believe in love?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
How is bank?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
I understand. I'm so sorry
You can stay tonight.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Put the fucking kettle down.
John.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
What did he say? Tell me!
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants money.
He wants a lot of money.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Just leave her alone.
I'm so sorry.
Is that everything?
Yes.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
Yes.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
Yes.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
I don't understand.
Syevodnya?
Syevodnya
"Frenzy".
They go. John. They go.
What's wrong?
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
You don't understand anything.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
I don't want to know.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
So what are you going to do?
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
In the world.
I do. I want to very badly.
So you're just going to be vindictive
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Where's the restroom?
What?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
What?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Give me some money.
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
So uh...
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Oh Jesus.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
He will come back.
Excuse me?
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Why not?
Shut up. I'm not listening.
You don't want to talk about it.
No.
We'll pretend it never happened.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
I don't hate you.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
And? What are you saying?
And. It's wrong.
And who says what is wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
Some... What does that mean?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
Why?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
So now you hate all women?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
What?
You...
I got what I paid for.
It wasn't what I wanted.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand me.
Excuse me?
Get out
You are throwing me out.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
I wasn't saying anything.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
I don't have nothing.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No.
Have you had any before?
Are you scared?
What happened between you and the blonde?
What?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I'm sorry.
What?
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I'm trying to quit.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Nobody's that unhappy.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
I don't know.
What was her name?
No. I think I better just go.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah. No thanks.
Please. Why not?
Okay. Goodbye.
Something else.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
It's not mine.
It's not mine either.
Why?
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.
What does it mean?
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
My name's Sophia.
Is the flight full?
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
You have excellent English.
Thanks.
How do you want to pay?
What are you doing?
Just wanted to see.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Then start taking them seriously.
Lazarus?
Oh! Gave me a start.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
You hurt it?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Angela?
Yes?
I need to uh...
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
Is your niece older than 12?
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
You didn't have to do this.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
I bet you have loyal customers.
You liked what I brung ya?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
At church?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
You gonna sing me somethin'?
When? Now? Oh. No.
Hey.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
What do you need?
More cough syrup?
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Hi.
Hey.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Can I put it in your mouth?
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
For your hands?
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
Still need a lift?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
Holy shit.
Yeah.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Sure.
What happened?
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
She's around. Always is.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
You been home yet?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
That's not right, really, cuz I...
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
Now wait...
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
You gonna steal my truck?
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
The fuck you laughin' at?
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Better?
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
I keep the heat on.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
I deserve better than this.
Better than what you give.
Rose... please...
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
God forgive you, for how you done me...
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Let go of my arm...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
LAZ, I said let...!
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
YOU SHUT UP!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Or what? OR WHAT?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You sayin' you'll do what?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Don't... don't say that to me...
Like a man.
Teh... Tehronne?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
How long... how long I been out?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Two days?
Where's Ronnie?
Well I don't...
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Don't need none.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Let me say somethin' first...
Why you got me chained?
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
The fuck you been doin' to me?
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
Gal, you ain't right yet.
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
How you let men treat ya like they do?
What?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
What do you want?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
You some kind'a pervert?
No ma'am.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
In my house, you watch that lip...
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
I said... STOP!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Itches.
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
My God, gal, don't you got no SENSE? I ain't sayin' I ain't weak? Shit. Playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!
Let go of me...
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Uh-uh.
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
I don't fuckin' cook.
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
I can handle that.
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
You take it straight?
Want another?
We drinkin' buddies now?
Still makin' jokes?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
Could you do somethin' for me?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
I'm here with you.
Tell me what to do.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Where you gonna be?
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
What is it?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
By myself?
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
Yeah, gal I been here before.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
Don't think that'd be wise.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Sorry.
Looks like you know a song.
How you feelin' today?
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
What I love.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
I don't want you to let go.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
You need some weed?
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Huh?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
Shit. Who hasn't?
Why you say that?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Now, hold up.
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
What'chu sayin'?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
What'chu sayin'?
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
Uh-huh.
He tapped that.
Naw!
Nuh-uh.
How a girl get like that?
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Why's his britches round his knees?
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Goin' dove huntin'?
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Not like that.
Then what?
The hell is this shit?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
Heard about this morning.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
You won't at the square this mornin'.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
Why she got a chain on her?
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
Please don't tell my daddy.
So...  That your first time?
Yes'sir.
I skipped lunch.
Thank you.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
You a preacher?
That's right.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You could put it that way.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
What's on your mind?
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
This ain't gonna work.
Rae...
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Rae don't do this now...
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Hey.
Hey.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Yeah?
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
Are you wasted?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Holy shit!
What?
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
I'm a what?
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
Got in a little accident.
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
You need money again?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I just wanted some make-up.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
The hell are you talkin' about?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
You got any money?
Thought you had a man for that.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
I think she got to you, pappy.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
... It's not like you were slow or anything... I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
What's this?
Back-up.
Get rid of it.
Why?
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
-- I should tear your head off.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
What are they doing now?
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Frank Abolofia.
Some party.
Maybe we should do something?
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
Not a prayer.
What'd you say?
Nick... You up?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Go to sleep, Charlie.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
I didn't know.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
Let's go.
Nick, we can't just --
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
Let's grab some food.
This should be it...
This the right place?
Getting very weird.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Squid?
Joyce can be nice.
What'd she say?
You cool, Ich?
Cool?
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
What does Charlie mean?
Short shift?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Connie...
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
Give me a break, would you?
Are you expecting anyone?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Nick!
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why the hell not?
What happened?
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
Why weren't you at the platform?
You must leave?
Yeah...
I've continued working on the case!
How'd you get this?
Know her?
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
What's he saying?
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
What'd I tell you?
You toler -- yes, tolerate me.
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Nick...
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Ichiro --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Yakuza.
She disappeared... shit!
You can't come in.  They don't want --
Gaiijin.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
I'm not drunk...
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Nick --
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
Nick!
Where does this Sugai live?
A resort city, Beppu.
What...?  Why?
Because he knows how to get to our man.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
It's very small.
Big enough.
It's illegal, Nick.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
What's in the box?
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
No...
Let's go.  Him first.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
No.
Start it.
You did great, Ichiro.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
How many men?
I couldn't tell.
Joyce?
I don't know.
Someone attacked him.
Thank you.  You have one?
I'm sorry.
What's that for?
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Why's that?
You all right?
Yes...
Louder, pal, louder.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
We can't lose.
Don't give him any more.
Ich said you left.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
Gaiijin?
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
She ever pull down her shades?
Don't be an ass.
He's on duty.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
I need your help, Joyce.
Where's Ich?
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
I need someone to translate for me.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
And I'm supposed to care?
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
He drinks.
Where's the wife?
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember saying yes.
They want your autograph.
Who am I supposed to be?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
We're in?
No one's keeping him here.
I still think you're a bastard.
What if I chant?
Can't make you change your mind?
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Might be different in New York.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Keep the change.
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
Guess I'm on a roll.
She's such a long way home for you.
This is my stop.
I'm amused.
How big a package we talking about?
This by this...
Dope?
Not in that company.
Yeah.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
What...?  What if I say no?
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Why me?
It's not your job.
He was my partner.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
I planned on catching him, Captain.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
He killed a police officer.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
I want a gun.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
You're foreigners.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
Could you fill me in?
Because I want you to tell me.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
What's this?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
You had my help, detective.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
I have to get to Sugai.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
I want him.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
The families who control the casinos?
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Why tell me this?
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
You trust me?
With these?
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
If I say no?
Good.
That wasn't our deal.
You want him dead too.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
You certainly have a nice place here.
He knows what he's doing.
If he won't cooperate?
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Let's go while there is still time.
What's the point?
Not to be trapped.
One man.  He must be good.
Then go get him.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
What's the problem?
Death.
I want more life, fucker.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
Why?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
But not to last.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
I've done some questionable things.
Also extraordinary things.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
What, Sebastian?
What generation are you?
Show me something?
We have a lot in common.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Of course not.
You could help us.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
He could?
His company made us.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
No.
When do you deliver your project?
You're our best and only friend.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
Just thought I'd...
What's going on down there?
He's not ready yet.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
I think, therefore I am.
I want to do it.
Six, huh?
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
What was he after?
You got a machine on it yet?
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Industrial refuse.
Yeah.
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
I was just about to have my dinner.
She was gonna get away.
I didn't like her.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Yeah.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Yeah.
She's not with you?
Take a number.  Canapt 1700, tenth floor, Villa Vita District, Olympia South.
Got it.
If you don't, we will.  It has to be total, Deckard.  That's an order from as high as it comes.  Got it?
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Well, when do you get paid?
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
You equipped for random questions?
Why, yes, of course.
You start.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
How do I stop one?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Okay, but...
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
I know all that.
Yes?
Do you have something against science?
Not if it works.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Next.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Number three.
I think I have no money.
It's okay.  Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Thank you very much.
Prosit.
You want to see my friends?
Sorry, don't have the time.
Those cockroaches?
How long you had these guys?
Prosit.
I like you.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
How old am I?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
I'm doing okay.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Money?
No.  I got a problem.
Let's hear it.
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
These aren't just...
Nerves of steel.
No rust?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Meaning?
During the road test...
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Huh huh.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
But you haven't put in for emigration.
Nope.
You're going to be over the limit.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
What if you change your mind?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
You sure?
Why didn't you go?
Too old.
Taffey Lewis?
Yes?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
What did she want?
Who?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
What night?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
What's suck night?
Book the good ones for where?
What shows?
I don't know nothing about it.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
What the fuck for?
It that mother real?
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
It's a good job.
The best.
Does it eat?
Jeezus!
Sorry.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
I bet I would.
Me.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
It's artificial?
Are you apprehensive?
I'd take him to the doctor.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
I'd never get an abortion.
Why not?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
In your opinion.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
Is there anything else?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I've already got more help than I need.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
You use your equipment, don't you?
So?
Do I make you nervous?
I can imagine.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
What do you want me to do?
You ever take a bath with a man before?
I told you I'd come back.
You did?
Me and my dad.
Where is he?
Dead.
How come you're not on the job?
How are you doing?
What do people do in the afternoon?
Do you dream?
Did you cry when your father died?
Yeah.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
What?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Like?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Hmmm?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
They could clean around the arrangement.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
But then how can you...
This feels stupid.
You're sick, Deckard.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Uh-huh.
What's a long time?
Ten years.
Because it's not.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
What difference will it make?
You know what I think?
What?
Where the hell you been?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Bad?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Thanks.
Black?
Is this to be an empathy test?
Yes.
May I ask a personal question?
No.
But in your profession that is a risk.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Well?
If she is, the machine works.
How many questions did it take?
She didn't know?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
And how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
Discreetly.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
How do you know I'm not?
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
I'm tired of this.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
What?
What desert?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
But how come I'd be there?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
A tortoise.  What's that?
Know what a turtle is?
Same thing.
But I understand what you mean.
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
How come you were in my truck?
What's your name?
Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
I don't have one.
What about friends?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
You look... better.
Just better.
Beautiful.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Methuselah Syndrome.
What's that?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Is that why you're still here?
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
What makes you think so?
Hi!
Yes?
Oh, now, that's a great one!
You like it?
Bravo!
This is my new friend...
You're kidding!
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Your mom was a dancer?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
How do you do?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Come where?
My office.
Well, that depends...
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
How do you do?
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Please excuse this interruption.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
What?!
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Get out of here!
Where are we going?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
You're lost?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Dickhead?
What's wrong with you?
I came on a bus.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Oh, that's nice.
So far?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Again.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
It was amazing.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Nope.
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
And that's it?
Yes.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Heck, no!  What?!
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Perry?
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
How's that?
Oh, I could die...
Over this?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
Take it. damn it!
Why are you doing that?
I haven't brushed yet.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
No.
Thank-Q!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
I think it's the eyes.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Watching television in color.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
See, ya.
What?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
...Okay.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why not go to work for me?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
They like Dr. Pepper.
My Mom and Dad.
Very funny, smart ass.
Wait! Wait!
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Thank you.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Name it.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
A wife?
Yes.
What for?
Because I want to get married.
Why?!
I don't want to be alone.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Bites what?
It does?
Sure.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
They're all divorced?
Everybody's divorced.
It didn't used to be that way.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
One who's not a mutant.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Two weeks.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Could we talk about that a little later?
Of course.
Get out!
Yes, ma'am!
You almost got us killed!
I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!
You said it would be easy!
I was wrong!!
Is this your house?
Yes!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
Thank-Q!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Yes!
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
Where's he gone?
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
He has a computer?
Sure.
In the house?
May I please be excused?
All right.
The what?
About clothing?
Yeah.
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Hey, Eve!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
No!  Not crazy!
Do I look crazy?
I thought I was here to meet women.
Not that one!
I like her.
What have you ordered?
What about her?
No way.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Okay. I like that.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Really?
That's ridiculous.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
What?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
You wanted to see me!
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
Adam?!
I don't blame you!
I'm leaving, too.
But, Eve, I would--
Eve?!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
I'm really sorry!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What?
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
I know first aid!
There.
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Is that what you call it?
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Sing it to me.
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
Uh-huh. Adam?
Yes, Eve?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
My pleasure.
It was at least as good as the sky.
Really?  Okay!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Hi, Eve!
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
No.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Is that a birthday cake?!
Yes, it is.
Is this because of the radiation?
What?
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Are you all right?
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Yes.
I've got to go, now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul�!
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
These are wonderful.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Why?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Then why go there?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Well, do we just go on up?!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
I promise. Is that all?
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
But, I don't understand.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Uh-huh.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
You're sure?
That's what everybody believes?
Yes, sir. It's true.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
Uh, I think they have.
You have very nice ceilings.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Not particularly.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I love Lucy!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Right on the button.
That's right?
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
1959.
Who use to own it?
Russia.
When did we get it from them?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What's the capitol?
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
This must be very new.
Yeah.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
I don't think so.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
No.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
Yeah?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Not on him.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
Almost all of them.
The recovery is very impressive.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
Why did you park way back there?
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
What?!
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
You bet!
So, did you buy a movie?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Good-bye, Adam.
And thanks for always being happy!
You dial nine to get out.
Of what?
The hotel.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
What?  What is it?!
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Up there!!
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Whatcha looking at?
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Hello.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Elbows, Son.
Sorry, Mom!
Dad!
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll be all right.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Right.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Yes?
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Yes, ma'am.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
What?
We have to go.
This is your bedroom?
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No.
Oh, my God!
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
What about relatives?
All back East.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
Good god.
You got a light, honey?
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Really?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Well, put it down and come in!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
It shuts off automatically.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
No.  They all do.
You hear that?!
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
How long will we have to stay down here?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Days??
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Yes, dear!
Home sweet home!
What's that noise?
The locks?
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Thirty -five years!
Then after that it's safe.
To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
No.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
What?
Is there a problem?
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
No.  I think it's just right.
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Yes!
If I...you know...
Right here!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Why?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Watch this!
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Hi, honey!
Calvin!
Get the presents and do the lights.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
What did you wish for, Adam?
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Let's eat our cake.
Yes...
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Would you excuse me?
In the generator room again?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Mutants?!
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
No.
Yes.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We stay down here.
We do?
Yes.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
Well, I am the head of this household--
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
He's smart.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
How long will you set it for this time?
I thought ten years.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
Some time.
What are you bitching about now?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
You came back for these?
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Stop it, you two!
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
I knew you'd like him.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Oh, yes.
Give me your hand.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
I don't know.
You're serious, aren't you?
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Well, that's blunt!
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Alright, I will.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Well, what do you think?
I think...it...works.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
That water's freezing!
Just be yourself.
Always good advice.
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Um... Eve?
Go to the bathroom.
He go back to the hotel?
What's that mean?
We did not leave together.
What's it to you?!
Those sluts!
Where are you going?
To bed.
To bed?
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
Yes, you do.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Uh, yes, you do.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Yes, you do!
Or have perfect table manners.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
What?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Where did he get all that information?
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
He left with Sophie.
What?!!
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
I don't think so.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Gay.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
What do you want to do with it?
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
What's wrong?
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
Have him committed.
Yeah! That's thinking.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
I don't know. I like to think so.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
To get some frozen poultry.
We came back to the house!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
What?!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Adam!!
Where?!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Wolf One -- say intentions.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Tower, say again!!
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Frank. Come in.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
To your health, Frank.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
Yes.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come into the study a minute.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
It must be great.
Jeffrey?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
The criminals are winning.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Is Sandy part of this?
No, not at all.
Only you and the photo lab.
You're all through with this now?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Not yet.
Yes? What is it?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
That oughta do it.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I wanted to see you.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Well.
THEN WHAT?
Never before this.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
No. Come on.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
What do you want from me?
I, I don't know.
Do you like that?
Do you like talk like that?
No.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Sure I'm alright.
Don?
No.
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Yes.
See my nipples?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Yes, I like you.
I made it go down the toilet.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
Do you know?
No.
You don't?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Then don't talk about killing.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Don't say that.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
Hi, can I come in?
Why are you here. Whatiya want?
I, uh.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
I liked being with you last night.
Oh shit.
Frank? Can you stand up?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
No.
Falling.
Who is Don?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Yes.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. I should go.
Come in.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Yes. Frank--
Frank is coming?
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
Yes.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Frank would open you.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
I asked first.
Sometimes I think I do.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You what?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I'm glad you do.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Dorothy. No!
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
You called me Jeffrey.
I did. Are you?
Yes.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
I guess I should go.
I want you to stay with me.
I'll call you.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh no.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
It's okay. It's okay.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
Don? Where is he?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Frank gone?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Alright, suit yourself.
He's comin' back? What for?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Hello, baby.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Hello, daddy.
Mommy's here.
Who's this fuck?
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Where are we going, Frank?
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Frank?
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Hello?
No thanks.
No thanks. What does that mean?
I don't want to go.
Go where?
On a ride.
Heineken.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Here's to Ben.
Hey? You like to walk.
What?
What are you lookin' at?
Nothing.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Yes.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
What time are visiting hours?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Well. Okay.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
What?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I'm going out for awhile.
Do you want the car?
Can I use the car tonight?
God, you scared me.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Yeah, I know.
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
That sounds great!
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
No.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well.
No, you're right.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Hi Dad.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Uh-uh.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Am I bothering you?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
Terrible boring.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
That's too bad.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Maybe so.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
Where are they?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
What happened to him?
I've gotta go in.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I'm here, aren't I?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Alright.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
So, what's next?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
Yes. I do.
You really want to do this, don't you?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
That sounds good.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Why not?
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah, but.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
OK.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Okay, yeah, call.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Yeah.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Are you sure?
Okay, thanks.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
What did you see?
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
You want a Dairy Queen?
You want to tell me about it?
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
You saw a lot in one night.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah?
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Okay, be careful.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Goodnight.
You were late.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Oh yeah?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey!!
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yeah.
Jeffrey? Why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
What is it?
What was that all about?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
It's okay.
You look beautiful.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
NO.
Let's wait for some slow one.
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
My father has a gun at home.
No.
Dorothy Vallens?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. No. Why?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I should go with her, Sandy.
Go ahead.
Sandy?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Look Jeffrey.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Come on out a minute, okay?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Stop it Mike.
What did he bring him in for?
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Just for him?
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Up where?
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Fuck you.
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
Hey, I just...
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
The Duke?  What did you do?
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Yes mother.
Are ya ready?
Yes sir.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Look under the body.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
What?
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Where's your gun?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
Anybody you think is evil?
Yes.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
What?
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
You think they sold me out? No way.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
What happened?
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
Anybody see ya?
Yeah, well...
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
What the fuck are you doing?
What? What is it?
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Look again for fuck sake!
Shit.
They got nothing.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.
You guys?
We're here brother.
Hello.
Mother, is that you?
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
No ma! No!
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Yeah, we promise.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
We... met them last night.
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
We paid attention in school.
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Be careful.
We're alive.
What are you going to do?
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
Would someone please come over here and...
Fuck!
me up the...
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
Hey Murphy?
Aye.
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Oh, Jesus.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Absolutely not.
Destroy all that which is evil...
For what?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
What?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
I don't know they just always need it.
Is that right, Rambo?
Nervous?
A bit.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
That was way easier than I thought.
Aye.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Oh, we're good man.
Nine bodies.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
Yes.
Who did you kill?
So what do you think?
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
Give the guy a shot.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
He isn't to be touched.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Yeah?
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Holy shit. You're the first one that's ever got that.
And number three, Dolly.
Uh... two shooters!
So, what do we do now?
She was in here when it went down.
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
Of course they were. How many?
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
How do you figure?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
What?
You... oh god, why?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
My, my...
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little...
Pee...Per...Man.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
It was... It was...
So what are you thinkin' here?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
The what man?
The fat man.
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
And the pennies?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
The Greeks. The Italians.
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
What about one guy with two guns?
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
What?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Who the...
Twist of lemon!
Chief, what the fuck is this?
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
How many bodies, Greenly?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
Witness?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Who were the victims?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
What the...?
Oh my god!
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Promise me boys.
Right now.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Fuck you!
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Hello?
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hello?
Hey, Murph.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
No. You sure you're okay?
Hurry the fuck up!
This is some crazy shit, man!
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Liberating isn't it?
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Worst day of my life, man.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
You bet your ass he will.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Hello? You there?
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
What is it my son?
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
You feel?
Yes.
Has he now?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
I guess not.
You're right.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
I believe these young men are right.
You know them personally?
Yes.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Forgive me father.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Yes.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Don't do this my son.
Open it!
Father, I'll do you right here.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.
I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
The... The funny man.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
He's a nigger.
Continue the joke.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
What does Starsky say?
He says. This is he.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Would they do that?
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
She's really kind of hot.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
How was I ridiculing you?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
That sets it off.
It had an alarm.
Yeah, I heard that.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Loop around real fast.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
You think we're going to be chased?
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Dignan, calm down.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Where's the manager?
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
Is that the manager?
Holy shit.
What about what that guy said?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
Like he meant it.
Yeah.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
What's wrong with him?
What do you think?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Can I get that credit card from you?
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
See if mine are in there.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I'll just say it.
OK. Go ahead.
You owe me fifty bucks.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
May I have a word with you, please?
What the fuck is going on here?
What. What's the matter?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
They don't?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Which one was that?
He needs to hire an attorney.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
As long as he gets out OK.
See, now we've got a plan.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
This was in fourth grade.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Where was it parked?
That coward. Son of a bitch.
Maybe he just went to the store.
He went back for his brother.
This morning.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
Why don't you come with us.
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I wish I'd been there.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I have an idea for that.
What?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I don't think we can do that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
She doesn't need to know.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Shh.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
I think we better go home.
Don't panic, Anthony.
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Our money situation is not good.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
We've got sixteen dollars.
I know.
I had to give some to Inez.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
She needed it.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Shut up!
When'd you get back?
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
I want you to look at this.
What is it?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.
Who's Mr. Henry?
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
What time did he say to be here?
You could give somebody a concussion.
What do you think?
Dignan. Take it easy.
Get out of the way.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Shit, Dignan.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Eleven fifteen.
OK. Mark that down.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Next week we'll be drinking pi�a coladas.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
I don't think you will.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
He was a nice guy.
Do you like Inez?
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
You're all clear.
Roger.
We all set?
Uh-huh?
Take your second position.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Any activity?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Good. It's supposed to be.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
I don't know.
What's happening? What's going on?
It's going back down.
Freeze!
Nobody move!
Help me move him.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Where's Kumar?
I don't know.
What are you doing?
Come on.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Dignan, it's too late.
Like amnesia.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
He did?
Yeah.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
You think Applejack knew?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
What do you mean?
You're living on a sailboat?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Where?
Does it float?
So how is it in there?
What's he in for?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
You're kidding.
No. I'm not.
How?
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
What?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. And Bob. Remember:
Scale the --
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
You know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success?  The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
You mean like techniques?
You mean a safecracker?
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
What do you mean?
That was a test?
How does that feel?
Did Dignan take the test?
Yes, he did.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Me?
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Are you afraid?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Death.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
No. Bob did.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Yeah.
We're renegades from despair.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Absolutely.
Why'd you want to help us?
Future Man.
Who?
Did you ever steal a car before?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Hector woudn't do anything.
Could you grow cinnamon?
Let them fight.
Are you serious?
See you.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
There's a million places to hide around here.
I hope not.
Where you going?
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
You think he got my license plates?
How long are they going to hold him?
Anthony, I --
What?
Bob, where you going?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Why not?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
You think I'm improving?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
No, I don't mind.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Was Future Man adopted?
Let's not even talk about it.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Give him a second.
You OK, Bob?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
What are you doing?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Jesus, Bob.
Yeah.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
It's in the driveway.
How do you say nineteen?
Dies y nueve.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
No.
Cuba.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
What?  What?
Like silk?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
You're Anthony?
Yeah.
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
Uh-uh.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
I can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
What do you mean?
Where'd they come from?
The front stairs.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
Wait. Did he see us?
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
What?
Are you a fag?
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
I don't know about that.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Well, what do you think?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
No.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
They are.
So who's going to know?
He looks like he was designed by scientists. For desert warfare.
That never would of --
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
What are you talking about, Bob?
You stole a Trans-Am.
Yes. I did.
OK, Bob.
It's true, Dignan.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
How much could you grow? Realistically.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
You're paranoid, Bob.
What was that all about?
What did I say?
The guy is fucking insane.
I warned you, Dignan.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Where'd she go?
I think we might of scared her.
I'm going to take a look at this.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
That's my responsibility.
Bob.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I paid for it.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
He electrocuted someone?
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
That's too bad.
What are you doing?
What happened?
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
This is natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Did we get it?
How much is there?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
You really think he'll remember you?
Bob, will you please listen?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Way to go, Bob!
I told you they were there.
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
Is he chasing us?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
Bob. Are you coming?
You can go first, Bob.
My brother's in jail.
The weed.
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
That could be anybody's.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
How long has he been in there?
I don't know.
What do you mean get back?
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
Come on, Dignan.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I'm going back.
Not in that car you're not.
Watch me.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
I can't do that, Bob.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
Just get in the car, Bob.
What's his name?
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Dignan.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Not bad.
Come on in. What you been up to?
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
You said 48 hours!
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
Bullshit.
Come on!
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
I'm sorry, Bob.
That's OK.
Come on, Bob.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Scarecrow?
Everything OK?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
I couldn't hear anything.
What's wrong with Applejack?
He's having a heart attack or something.
Is he breathing?
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
I didn't think there was an alarm.
The elevator broke.
Where's Applejack?
Applejack drove.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
What's that?
Do you have your own room?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do they let you --
Hold on --
Here we go.
Wait a second --
How's that 700 bucks coming?
I'm working on it.
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
I might have mentioned it.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
How you doing, Bob?
You keeping out of trouble?
I'm trying.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
He said what?
He said you ran away from home.
How long do you have to go?
26 weeks.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Ground defense.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Is he in?
What do you mean grammar?
The grammar?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Oh, yeah.
Is he good?
Join the party, fellas.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Yes.
Well, I think --
Where did he go?
Who? Applejack?
Why did he go that way?
What's the story?
Can't get it. It won't...
We're closed, sir.
He left his sweater.
Well, I left some money in there.
Where?
Where is he? Where is Rob?
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?
No, my friend knows her.
You like Chicanos?
You a good pool player.
Got a little lucky.
I don't know.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
No. Just pool.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
How's the weather down there?
Mr. Henry?
Come on in!
It's locked.
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
The world needs dreamers, son.
What?
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
You told me Bourne was dead.
There was a mistake.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Will it track back to us?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
And the Landy woman?
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
What do you mean?
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
Save it for Bourne.
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
Treadstone.
Never heard of it.
That's not gonna fly.
And what are we looking for?
I want to know about Treadstone.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
I want to know what happened.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
...this is Conklin's computer.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Excuse me.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
Don't you want answers?
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Sorry to wake you.
What?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Did he say anything to you?
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Sit down.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Why not? It was just money.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Had to be done.
No good options left?
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
No. You lost your way.
Sir...
She say what time I should call?
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
What do you have, Danny?
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
And?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Keep going...
Lots of people...
Who else knows about this?
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Show me again...
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
That's not what happened to your parents.
Then what?
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
They loved you.  And I killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
You're a liar.
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
Because you're afraid!
I have to go now.
Is this really happening?
I emptied it.
Felt a little light.
Front. Use your teeth.
You still should've moved.
So why didn't you kill me then?
What do you want?
Conklin.
Try again.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
I don't know.
Who sent you to Greece?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
Pamela Landy?
I don't know who that is.
You called it in?
I'm sorry.
-- car keys?
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
No. There's nothing new.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
-- it hasn't been two years --
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
I worry when you get like this.
It's just a nightmare.
Sleep. Sleep now.
I should be better by now.
But it ends up the same.
No... How?
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
But you're sure?
He was at the campground yesterday.
So...
That's crazy.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...
Where --
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
We can't wait to be sure.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- where's left to go? --
You drive.
What?
Switch! You drive!
-- where? -
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
Where are you going?
What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
I love you, too.
I wanted to kill him.
But you found another choice.
I did.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
I know it's a dream.
You do?
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
See that tram coming around the corner?
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
Who is Pamela Landy?
Why is she trying to kill me?
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
What is this, a game?
Say it.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
A Russian?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
And you got to him before we could.
I killed him???
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
Why are you here, then?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Abbott?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
What do you mean?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
My first job.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
No... Jason... please...
I was here!
It's me.
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
I want someone I know to take me in.
Who?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Oh, shit...
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
What's that?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
We need to get in there.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
Looks like he's been detained.
Who's going? Us?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
-- go -- take the van! --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
You're sure?
What? The tapes?
Show me.
This is everything? Is there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
That's where we came out.
It's a lot of money, Pam.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Still...
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Mr. Nevins?
Who's this?
How long have you worked for the agency?
Me? Four years.
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
What kind of problems?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Amnesia?
Good luck.
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Believed what?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So he fooled you.
If you say so.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
You mean, did I want a date?
Did you?
Some women like Dobermans --
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
And why is that?
Is it fresh?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Let's give him half an hour.
So?
Do we know what this says?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
By who?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Are we hacking or asking?
Yes. In that order.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
I don't want to leave.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
What are they doing?
But... what will you do?
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
We must sue for peace.
Peace?!
We cannot defeat this --
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
So let the council swear publicly.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
Does anyone know his politics?
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
He was a modest man.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
He won't come.
Longshanks promised!
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
What news of the north?
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
The Scots will fight for us?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
What is it?!
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
No, M'lord.
Now, my flower, do you understand?
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Good day to you, M'Lords.
Wallace's followers.
The little cow is insane --
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
When will his trial be?
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
You fancy him.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
I'll wait... back there.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Stephen ready?
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Rest, William.
I rest.
You know it's a trap.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
That's just a dream, William!
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
Keep these. We're going too.
They're coming!
How many?
Three, maybe more!
Armed?
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
Wanna stay with me tonight?
Test of manhood.
You win.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
You'll move
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
A common thief.
We must run in different directions!
We don't split up!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
Where is my son?
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
Shall I leave, M'lord?
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
No. He did not.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
I have faced him. Have you?
Let her speak.
Treason. Against whom?
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
It matters not, he is thy king!
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
I do not confess.
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Thank you for accepting.
Thank you for inviting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
You've been here before?
Did it work?
I want... to marry you!
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
Nor I!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
You scare me.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
I've missed you.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
Tonight then.
Then when?
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
And I with you. But you must wake.
I need you so much! I love you!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
How do you know this?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
I am the Princess of Wales.
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
It's battle I want, not talk.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
Peace is made is such ways.
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
Why did you?
You have... you have a husband.
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
You will die! It will be awful!
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
I am trying.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I must... consult with my father.
We can't stop!
They've tricked us.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
What is it?
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
What?
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Anything.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
And the bad news?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
But you must have something to go on?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
No dances, just tell me.
We're gonna be late again.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
Darn it!
Um... can dad come this time?
You know the answer to that.
Can't he come out for one day?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
All the dads are gonna be there.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
No.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
What happened?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
I don't know... I don't remember.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I... I blacked out.
Please, mom. People will talk.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
Sure...
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
How long will I be in here?
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
What does that mean for Evan?
There must be a way to fix this.
Fix?
You're. Acting. Like your father.
How. Did you. Know that?
Just. Like. Jason.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
Can you protect me?
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Straight up.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Weirder than this?
What did you see? What did it look like?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Dad lives here?
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Yes.
Where are you now?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Are you hurting her?
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
But I... I need those books.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
I thought you were a December baby.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you stupid or what?
What?
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Huh?
Get out. Both of you.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
Oh God... what did we do?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Ouch.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
I deserve a lot worse.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Not since we were kids.
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Of course.
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
It was a long time ago.
I know, but...
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Jesus, Kayleigh, you're...  Incredible.
Where... where are my clothes?
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
Why are you doing all this for me?
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Are you okay?
What do you mean?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Like how?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I walk differently?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
I get it. You can drop it now.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Ha! Where's that?
What's happened to you?
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Why's that?
Because you're... different.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Yeah?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Oh? There's proof now?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
I just thought you should know.
Know what?
There's one major hole in your story.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Where are we going?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Is something the matter?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I was?
I don't get it.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
And...?
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Then you think it might have worked out?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
What time is it?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
...yes.
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
We'll find out soon enough.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
And you are...?
Evan Treborn.
So what's the point?
Smells like sex in here.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Come on, go on...
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
I couldn't cut the rope.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Are you sure you even packed it?
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What?
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Destroy it?
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
What the hell are you doing?
Listen to me good, Evan...
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Just get out, didja?
Huh?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
I come from a big family.
Meant no offense.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
I thought I was the bad guy!
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Lenny? Come on!
Shut up, Tommy!
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Here you go, buddy.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Yes?
How did you get in here? You're under age.
I came with Captain Renault.
I should have known.
My husband is with me, too.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
He did. Captain Renault did.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
How long have you been married?
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
So you decided to go to America.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Yes, I'll bet.
Does he know that?
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Yes, Monsieur.
And you want to know --
-- Will he keep his word?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
You want my advice?
Oh, yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Good.
What is your name?
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Yes, Monsieur.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
I see.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
No thanks, Carl.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
I won't.
Goodnight.
Yes, I come.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
-- Tonight he forgot.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Here you are.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Er, good luck, yes.
Er, goodbye, sir.
Hello, Rick.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
It's not for sale.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale at any price.
What do you want for Sam?
I don't buy or sell human beings.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose we do.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
Practically no one.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
And the carrying charges?
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Yes, something.
Do you know where they are?
Rick?
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
And Mademoiselle?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
What are they?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
And the other alternative?
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Not an easy day to forget.
No.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
I will.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
We said "no questions."
Yes?
Why there is no other man in my life?
Uh huh.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
My German's a little rusty.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Strange. I know so very little about you.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, of course, we --
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
That's too far ahead to plan.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Please.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I didn't count the days.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Has it got a wow finish?
I don't know the finish yet.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
You can believe that if you want to.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
How did you get in?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Richard, I had to see you.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Please.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Put them on the table.
No.
For the last time, put them on the table.
And then?
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
And Laszlo?
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
No, not yet.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Everything is quite all right.
But why my name, Richard?
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
But Richard, no, I, I --
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
No.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
But what about us?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
And I said I would never leave you.
Yes.
Hello, Sam.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Where is Rick?
When will he be back?
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Does he always leave so early?
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
You are very kind.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
I must find out what Berger knows.
Be careful.
Goodnight.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
What happened with Rick?
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Apparently he has the letters.
Yes?
Did he give any reason?
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
Ilsa, I --
Yes, Victor, I was.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Be careful.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
Sam?
Yes.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick? Who's he?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
-- Is what?
Hello, Rick.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
How do you do?
How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
And I congratulate you.
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
We'll come again.
Good morning.
Good evening.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Go ahead.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
My office.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
What of it?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
Well, this might come in handy.
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
You love her that much?
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
But we made a deal.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No. It's all arranged.
Everything in order?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Yes.
I understand.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
No, Captain, please.
My bill.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
We'll be there.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
I slept very well.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
-- Thank you.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Yes.
I believe you have a message for him?
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
And that is?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Even in Berlin.
You will give us the names?
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
For the time being.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
What else, my dear Major?
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Good evening, gentlemen.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Ho, diplomatist!
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
Mademoiselle.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
A leader, like Laszlo?
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
But everybody's having such a good time.
But I have no excuse to close it.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
Why? What's in Lisbon?
It was a combination of all three.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
What, again?
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Manages what?
His escape.
Oh, but I just told you. --
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Is that a serious offer?
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Okay.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
I have my orders.
Yeah, you were saying?
Oh, how do you do?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Oh, no, Rick never --
Oh, it's my party.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
Yeah? Why?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
What friend?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Oh, thanks.
You're late.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
I have the letters right here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I have. Sit down over there.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
You think of everything, don't you?
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Our expenses?
Uh huh.
Where were you last night?
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?
Give me another.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Make it official, if you like.
What is your nationality?
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
Are my eyes really brown?
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Hello?
Put that phone down!
Get me the Radio Tower!
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
No.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
For how long?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Rick! Rick, help me!
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
I like it fine here.
He'll double what I pay you.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Boss!
Yeah?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
No.
You ever going to bed?
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Yeah, boss?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Uh, my watch stopped.
What's that you're playing?
Just a little something of my own.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
No, I don't.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
It's bad.
Worse than Warsaw.
Nobody remembers that.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Get up.
Can't.  Need water.
You've had today's water.
Thirsty.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
Do too much, I'll die.
No more water, you said.
Take it.
No.
Take it, damn it.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
You're putting off the inevitable.
Get water!
Fix raft first.
You're beautiful.  Marry me.
What are you doing?
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Why do they have to die for me?
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
They're on autopilot.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
What's so damn funny?
Jesus.
It's real.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
You can't make it.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
You know what happened to this?
As much as anybody.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
Oh?  You've tried?
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
Well, not really, I --
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
What brings you out to the sticks?
Had a package to deliver.
You?  Personally?
I had it on the island with me.
Yeah, a long one.
I've got lots of time.
Sonofabitch!
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
How was Russia?
Cold.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Chuck.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Merry Christmas eve.
Four four.  A record.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Hey, look at you.
He is a cute thing.
He's your cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
You know, for when you travel.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
You can't go now.
This isn't working out.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
No.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
There isn't any us.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I got married.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
I know.
If I'd known you were alive --
Her name's Hannah.
Is that Jango?
What's that?
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that, written on the sail?
There was a coffin?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
What was inside?
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Come on.  Try.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
You hated being alone.  Couldn't stand it.  Busy every minute.  Always plugged into something.
This is so unfair.
You okay?
What will you do?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
I love you, Chuck.
You too.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
And how was your Christmas?
When's the next Jumbo?
Anything else?
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Which I didn't have.
I am one lucky guy.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
If you say you are.
I most definitely say I am.
Yes, yes he did.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
Need some help?
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
You're Chuck Noland.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Thought you were going to bring her.
But chickens?
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Really?
What happened to your pants?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
Don't you even think about it.
The place is falling apart.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
When'd you start working here?
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Trying.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
What about the sender?
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
Kamal is not here.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What's going on down there?
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
How'd it go?
You what?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
But I might not have.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
I'm touched.
You fucked us over.
I was making a point.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
And never take.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
Forget it.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
That's why you're a gambling man.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
For the third time.
You are one sick fucker.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
It's me.
You're fucking dead!
I beat the odds!
Hello.
How about we go somewhere else?
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
I braided them.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
You were how long on this?
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
To life.
That's all there is.
Digital laser readers.
Take your time.
What?
That's what it's about.
What, then?
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
I need to do it.
Permission to come aboard, sir.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
Only if you can afford it.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
You weren't dreaming about me.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
They just want you to hire some new help.
He'll need clothes... some money...
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
These *credentials* are against the law!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
Dr. Homer Wells.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
I'm *not* a doctor!
I mean your parents.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
Why not?
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
You cook very well!
And that I can drive a truck!
Better than I can!
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
What's she so emotional about?
What'd she die of?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
So, Mrs...
Is your family in the apple business, too?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
I've never seen a lobster.
I know.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Where's Mandalay?
Burma!
Oh...
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
So. Not bored yet?
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
I better go.
A movie *outside*?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
And what did she die of, exactly?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
What's the *medical* explanation?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
At least you were never lonely.
You don't miss it?
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
I *know* this was right.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
*What* will be okay?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Mr. Rose *knows*?
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Nothing.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
Stop it! Just cut it out!
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
I know, I'm sorry.
He's *paralyzed*!
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
Please don't make me say it again.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
"...did." Well, okay.
Please don't...
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Do you think she'll be all right?
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
How is that Wally doing?
Hi...
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
I'm okay--I can walk.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
Wally thinks apples are boring.
I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
There! You said it was boring.
I love you, Wally.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
I thought they might take me.
They wanted a girl.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
That's true.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
That's a heavy sedation.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
I just wanted to ask you...
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Is *your* father dead?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's a nanny do?
She looks after other people's children.
Did you grow up around here?
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
Uh... it's the end of October.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Did you bite it?
I don't remember.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
What kind of plane are you flying?
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Really! Is it serious?
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
At what altitude?
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
They're migrants.
Migrants?
It's almost like flying.
What about the trees?
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
So. What should I do now?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
But she's your *daughter*...
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
What business is you in, Homer?
What's that? What's it called?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
I'm stayin', Homer.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
Where'd she get you?
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
First pregnancy?
Yes, for both.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
It looks like scurvy.
It's obviously an aborticide.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
I don't know it.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
In other words, scurvy.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
I haven't read that.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
Nobody's named this one yet.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Of course.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I am not a doctor.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Uh... sure.
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
We heard that one already, Homer.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Rose Rose?
It's just my heart.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
So what?
Do you like to read?
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
I'm not in trouble.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
You okay, Rose?
You're not yet three months, are you?
Not yet. What do you know about it?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
That's *it*?
Who cares?
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Do you know him?
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
Then it's malaria?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
When will he be home, Major?
They told me I was too old to serve.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
Don't this place look like home?
It look nicer then home!
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
They're *outrageous*, them rules!
*What* view?
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
I told him that you all is sick.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
*You* taught her, I suppose...
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
Rose Rose has runned away!
She took off in the night!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
Tough day?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
So, what do you do?
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Silicon Valley?
Can --
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
And you have this letter of intent?
We had to finalize the deal.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
What's this?
Let's just slow down for a second...
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Know who I am, Jake?
The Anti-Christ?
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
Grifters...
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
Keeping the Fix happy.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
I can see why you liked her.
But there were other factors.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Nice.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Like what?
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
I was doing it for them.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
We were back on.
After you cut her loose.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Alright... Turn around. She doesn't get shit, unless I get that money. Where is it?
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Guess so.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
So we go to the bar.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
We'll take care of it.
Ten is standard, sir.
Who's that?
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
Mob?
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Whoa. What?
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Masters of our own destiny.
Jake...
I'm going home
Moonan. Here. Shit...
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
Shit.
I told you, use less powder.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
It can buy you a new and better you.
Well, this is just fucking great...
You know what we're doing with the money.
And what about Big Al?
When?
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
How much we going after?
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
She up for this?
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
You'll be there?
Eight A.M. flight.
Calls?
Jake --
So that's it...
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
I have a good crew.
Minus one.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Why?
How much?
I think two million.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
I need you to stake me.
Stake you?
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Listen, Scooter --
Excuse me?
Look at you, you skinny prick.
Come here. Feel this.
No thanks. I'm good.
Come on. Harder.
I think I just broke my hand.
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Something stupid.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
Sorry, I --
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
Oh Jesus!
What -- What do we do?
That's not --
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Says who?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
You get an equal cut.
What about Customs?
I'll worry about Customs.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Mr. King, I think --
What the hell's his problem?
Don't worry about it.
You need to get a haircut.
What?
And some new clothes.
Why?
You're just going to have to trust me.
I don't trust anyone.
Uh... Everything okay?
He's gone.
Uh-huh.
I gotta go get a haircut.
You just put a mother of a jinx on us.
Lighten up.
You told me to change my hair!
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Look at you... You want to go.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Do you have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
It's more than that.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
How do you know I will?
You have really soft hands. Like a baby's.
How do you deal with --
WHAT?
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
Sounds respectable.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
Glenn talked you out of it.
He was looking out for you.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Jesus... Take it easy.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
What about...
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
No, I want my cut!
Sorry. I didn't know...
You got my cell. Leave a message.
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
You tell them the "Tale".
What do you want? An apology?
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Your mess.
Then shut up.
Stop waving that thing around.
Yeah.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
Miles...
It's bad luck.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
Meet me at my place later.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
We're working for the King.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
What do we need another Shill for?
Why?
Uh...
What?
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
We're getting a little old for running.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
Is it all fugasi?
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
Him.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
What do we do? We change the scam?
No, no, no! Not this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You with the hookers!
Escorts!
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
And we got rid of the red head.
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
Do you have a ticket?
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
I'm sorry.
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
You going to have the time?
King ain't gonna like this.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
What'd he say?
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
What's up with you? Bladder infection?
You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
What?
Stand up.
What happened?
Eee Oott Auught!
Sorry. What?
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Aces, Suits.
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Pretty much.
In over your head?
Can I speak to you in confidence?
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
Can't say.
Then who's the Banker?
I can handle it.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
It's not history.
So what do you want?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Still time.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
The King, huh? Nice going.
Just a tip.
What?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
A Fed? Is he close?
Speak.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Special Agent?
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Did he buy it?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
You guys awake?
Who?
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
What do you get out of it?
Peace of mind.
This guy must have been a real pain in your dick.
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
You sell it.
To who?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
You trust this Moonan guy?
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
It's just insurance.
That's what I'm talking about.
What are you doing?
High five.
Jack Manfred.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
Is it that bad?
Jack. Do you need a ride?
No. Thanks.
My car's in the garage.
Maybe another time.
I'll take you up on that.
You're shaking.
I hate cheats.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
Why did you quit?
I got scared.
I can imagine.
You called the casino a cesspit.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
I despise the job.
The Indian rope-trick.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Ouch.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
What kind of deal you looking to?
How about fifteen hundred?
What?!
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Eight-fifty.
Three years, two months. March '93.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
She went back to South Africa.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
I want a job, Giles.
All right. As what?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
I'm working on that soccer story.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Habib?
I'll try and make it.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
I found her in bed with someone.
I don't gamble.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Last hand.
I get it.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Not particularly.
And your lady?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
Not entirely.
How's that football story corning along?
I couldn't resist them.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You want me drunk?
You really are a beautiful woman.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
Where did you get it?
I. sold the car.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
You're my prisoner.
I want to hear it.
I've got a job.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
How did you land that?
It came my way. 450 a week.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Are you trying to read my palm?
What's the time?
How did it go?
You're shaking. What is it?
Tension. It'll go.
I loved it blond.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Are you drunk?
Probably.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
Marion, stop this.
You're my conscience.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
What about a drink on the way home?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
I'm on at nine.
I don't like it.
Why not?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Marion. It's a book.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
It's the truth.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
The door, Jack.
Leave it.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
I hope it brings you luck.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
I'll leave the casino soon.  I promise.
You will?
What?
You were talking in your sleep.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Never. Why do you ask?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Really?
How did you know I was here?
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Nothing about you.
Then what?
Leave me alone, Marion.
Why did you take the money?
I hate public transport.
I want to buy a car.
Great.
No.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
It's not that.
So how are you doing, dad?
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Yes, I know that.
Don't let yourself down.
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
I've lived there.
Oh hello.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
To coincidence.
There's a casino in this hotel.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
So why did you come to my casino?
First visit to London?
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
Near the casino.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Your father?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
The debts.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Do you believe in astrology?
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Absolutely not.
Toss you for it.
How did you hurt your hand?
Just an accident. Nothing.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
He doesn't gamble.
What happened?
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
Which side do you like?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I didn't.
I'm in trouble.
What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
They mean it.
Who's they?
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
You're serious.
And I thought you were only after my body.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
It won't.
But if it does.
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
Next time it'll be my neck.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
I can't do it, Jani.
I want you to forget what I said.
How much do you owe?
Let it go.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I'm sorry.
What for?
Yes.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
Do you?
Yes.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
And your hand too.
Would you like a drink?
I don't think we should meet again.
Hello...
Jani! Where are you?
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
How are you?
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Did you solve your problems?
Who...
Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
You did?
You've been avoiding me.
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
And what do you do, Lucy?
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where to?
Over the river.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
Nice car.
She's my baby.
How long have you worked at the casino?
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
What the fuck are you talking about?
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
What are you, a cop?
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
You're talking about complicity.
Who are these guys?
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
And the girls?
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Does Bella come here?
Hey Jack, join us.
No thanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I'm off. I need to sleep.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
Rough day?
What happened to Bella?
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
I put them on together.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
Has he?
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
Where did you go to school?
I was at Beadles.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
We check every four days.
Why four? And not three or five?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
Any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
You use two alternating, don't you?
We do.
Where's the magnet?
Haven't you forgotten something?
I don't think so.
Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched.
How many aces are left?
Five.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
You want me to check?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
What for?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
I don't gamble.
Ever?
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
How?
Girlfriend?
She's not in the gaming business is she?
Very impressive.
You can start Monday week.
Fine.
I just want the job.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
Does he win?
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
Thanks for the information.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Bruised.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
What flickering light?
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Oh. What's wrong now?
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Yeah.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
What's he doin'?
The key!
Key? Key? What is the key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
The key, goddamit, the key!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
It didn't go off.
We've got to disarm the bomb.
What was that, I didn't hear...
What the hell?
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Fuck that shit.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Well, there's the possibility of...
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
All right, then...
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Energy shielding positive function.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Check at six minutes.
Armed.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Thanks.
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
You are false data.
Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Snap out of it, bomb.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Of course.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Well of course I exist.
But how do you know you exist?
It is intuitively obvious.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Right!
This is fun.
Exactly.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That's it.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Why don't you have more time?
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
To explode, of course.
And you can only do it once, right?
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Of course not.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Yes, well...
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Hmmm...
So if you detonate in...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Mafhkin oble groop...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Pinback...
Yes, Doolittle.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Doolittle...
Yes.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
In a second.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
What are you gonna name it?
What?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Commander Powell would have named it.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Fred.
Wha?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Out where?
Veil nebula.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
-- automatic channels open --
-- Remark.
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
TALBY!
I need a diameter approximation.
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
I like it up here.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
I'm getting something here, on this readout...
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Not now!
Doolittle! Help me.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
What happened, Doolittle?
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Oh yeah?
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Ah... pity, pity...
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
That's correct, sir.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sorry.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Commander? Are you still there?
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Sir?
Talk to the bomb.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Sir?
Men... men... what happened, men?
Who are you?
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
No?
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
How I make my living, what's your point?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
I'm on a break.
No wire.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
What?
That's not why we're here.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
How come I never hearda you before?
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
None of your business.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Leave.  Now.
Can I say something in my defense?
Move it.
How're ya doin', Max.
You mean until you showed up?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
Do you know why I went after Justine?
She was there...
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Why would I be pissed?
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
What are you doing here?
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
What is it?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
No way.
But I'm afraid of--
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Where'd you clip this?
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Same old story.  Not interested.
What're you looking for?
A grand.
I ain't mad at you...
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
I don't get involved with guns.
I'll make it worth your while.
You're light a deuce.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
What a creep.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
You didn't...
Damn... Are you alright?
They took my daughter.
I know.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Can you help me get her back?
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
What else can we do?
Hello...
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
I don't want to move away.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
But why can't we stay here?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
No...
What makes you cry?
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Mommy, where are you?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
When?
Soon, baby.
Mommy, I'm scared.
You're a thief?
Thank God.
First time I ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
Whoever that is.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Who is...
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
Sorry about your window.
Lemme get my coat.
How'd you find me?
Wasn't that hard.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Too early to tell.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Lauren's not my wife.
Girlfriend?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Something.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Is the social studies class over for today?
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
I won't be staying.
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
You got a lotta nerve.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
Bent?
You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
How do I know you didn't?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
That would be appropriate, yes.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Yes on all counts.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
The other ones?
The other one like you...
You lost me.
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
How well do you remember the lab?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
How much do you know?
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
A girl.
Your basic hodge-podge.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
You said you could help.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
What's in it for you?
Your help.
I already don't like the sound of this.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I'm sorry.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
You believe that?
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
What's this?
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
I don't know what to say.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
We're quoting Mom again.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
With your help.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
Know where I can find her?
You don't want to.
But she does work here?
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
I need to talk to her.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
None.
Who is it?
A friend of your fiance's.
What do you want?
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Look, I don't know what you want--
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Oh?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You're also a fool.
I think you should go now.
This is not a place you wanna go.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
Say the words, "I understand."
I understand.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.
You did.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Thank you.
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
Then what?
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
Nothing on Hannah?
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
How's this about me?
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
You're crazy.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Got a pencil?
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Morning, Sunshine...
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
Straight.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
That's odd...
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
No.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Yeah.
A little what?
You know what I'm saying.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
How long you and me known each other?
A long time.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
A fog bank.
Gotta go.
Where?
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Unlikely.
And because he's my friend.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
Please...
They're prisoners to their genes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Only one I can think of.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Not right now.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
I actually know how this works.
Who are you?
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
And she bought that?
Make the call.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
She's got my word.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
You get it when I get her.
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Playing hooky again?
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
Tell everybody hey.
Catch you back at the wall.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Right, the big one-oh.
Hey, Sketchy--
We gotta talk.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Max--
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
You left out condescending.
But there's another side--
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
I'm the victim here.
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Exactly.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Does this person have a name?
Lydia.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
I'm a toy to her.
A toy?
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
What happens if you level with her?
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
And why should she?
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
She tells you how I've been--
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
I'll give it my best shot.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
She was the one--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
True, but--
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Okay, okay, okay--
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
I was on call.
I want you on call here.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
He's sick.
For a change.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
What about this?
Thanks, miss.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Huh?
Gin.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
You love him?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Hawk.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Got any KISS?
What's that?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Whoa... she is a killer.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
I-I c-can't...
No problem.
Sorry.
Jeremiah?
Beth? I can't believe it.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
We've got to take this slow...
Right, slow...
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Ann Arbor?
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
What's it worth to you?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
What are you, high?
Yeah.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Namely?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
What's in Sandusky?
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
One more time in English.
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
That's Sherry VanHafton.
Whoa... she just farted.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Damn straight we are.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Sunday, but...
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
What the fuck!
Uh... dudes?
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Cool, bro, now listen up...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
I think we should try sneaking in.
I found the Volvo.
No... You don't think...?
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Could be.
Are you gettin' wise with me?
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Dude, this is all I got.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Jam, listen up.
Hawk?
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
What's gone?
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Cool.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
They're what?
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
It was stolen!
I got...
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Go ahead, Jam.
Oh, hi, mom.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Ahh, sunshine.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
But, mom!
They're not idiots.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
What?!
Mom, what're we...?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
That's it?
Yeah.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
No.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Well? Continue! Continue!
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
A bustier?
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
I did it! I did it! We won!
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Simplicity, Hawk.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
It's gone.
But we took the keys?
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
What do you want?
Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
Two hundred bucks?
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Gimme your gun, boy!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
I don't even think you have a gun!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Is that your final answer?
I did?
Yeah, you did!
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Good morning, mongrels!
Good morning...
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Good MORNING!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
GOOD MORNING!
Hi... what's going on here?
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
What happened?
What was his name?
I feel bad for his family.
Yeah.
Dr. Monnitoff?
Donnie.
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Theoretically.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
So... that's it?
Like a DeLorean.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Like a spear.
Beg pardon?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
I'm not following you.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
When can I squeeze one out?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
I didn't say shit.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Dea ex machina...
What did you say?
How can you do that?
Why did you make me flood the school?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Who is... we?
Where did you come from?
I want to show you something.
You have a request?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
I am so sorry.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
How much longer is this gonna last?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
We went to a hotel.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
How old is Grandma Death?
What'd you do, Donnie? What'd you do!
Hey...
Hey...
Wanna walk me home?
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
You mean soap?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Wonder where we'll be then.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Why is that?
You're weird.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Where are we going?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Where are you going?
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Donnie?
Yeah?
Why?
What happened to your neck?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
With, like, images?
And what?
Well...
That's alright... I understand.
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
We're moving through time.
They suspended me for two days.
Are you okay?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
What? How long was I asleep?
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
What's wrong with you?
Will you please talk to me?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
Where is she?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Did you call the cops?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
What?
Come with me.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Why? Is this about the book?
No. Frank.
Is that a cellar door?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
People aren't that simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
You're such a fuck-ass.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Grandma Death.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
Do you get to meet Ed?
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
So how was school today?
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Do they know yet?
Know what?
Where it came from?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
Oh, shit!
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
You're my only son...
I know, Dad.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Who is Frank?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Why should we care?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Where are you going?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
What's "Cellar Door"?
Cellar door.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
So, I met a new friend.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is Frank.
I think he saved my life.
How so?
Don't you watch the news?
I don't own a television.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
He said to follow him.
Follow him where?
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
I met a girl.
What is her name?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Yes.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
Who is the boss?
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
How many times have you seen Frank?
Four times... so far.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
A sign from whom?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Is Callie still around?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
Nothing.
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
The good stuff.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
Yes.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
I... I was playing with fire.
People get hurt.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
But you were punished.
Yes. I went to jail.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
You've done it again?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
If God exists?
I think now that he might...
Because I'm so horny.
God exists because you're horny.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Where are we going, Donald?
I have the power to build a time machine.
How is that possible?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Then how is time travel possible?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
When will this happen?
I can see him right now!
Where is he, Donald?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Thank you.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Yeah.
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
I was just being honest.
Her name is Gretchen.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
What I think is going on with your son.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
I... What can we do?
If that's what you think is necessary.
Our son just called me a bitch.
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
What?
He was a year ahead of us?
Excuse me?
That's enough.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
How did you know --
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
What else?
Christ. Is that an axe?
Yep.
How did this happen?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Rose.
Kitty...
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Beg pardon?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
But now you can't go.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
Kitty...
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Chut up!
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
There's no rule!
What is this shit?
Wicked.
No more fuckin' for her.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Is Mom okay?
She's alive, sweetie.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
You're what?!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Really, Loretta?
You-betcha.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Loretta, never have kids.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
Thank God for bunge cords.
What is wrong with you?
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Really?
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Okay.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
This came for you, sweetie.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Airport Ho-Jo!
Loretta, don't do that.
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I gotta work with these women.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Oh, Amber...
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Amber? Here.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Your parents'd kill you.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Yah?
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Mrs. Leeman?
Huh?
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
Amber...
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
Oh shit!
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Go on! Get out!
Mom!
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Ow!
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
That's it, I'm goin'...
God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
C'mere. I love you so much.
Bye mom.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
I hate her!
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
What're you doin' here?
What?
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
I just did.
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Here, I didn't get any.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Amber, if I die from these fumes, will you be sure to cover the hickies on my neck?
Yeah...
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Hi...
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Oh man, you got leutefisk in your hair.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
I know.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Okay... well, bye.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Are we on "Cops" again?
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Hi.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Oh, naw. Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Loretta, shut it.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
So? Be real easy.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant!  If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU!
We was robbed.
Annette, just use your hand.
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
My dress'll reek.
I'm a mirror.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
That's right.
Okay?
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Dakota.
Ohio...
That bitch from...
What?
Wisconsin.
All right, then.
The bitch.
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
And the year before that?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Tammy Curry?
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
...You betcha. S'posed to be colder- n-a witches tit tonight...
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Lester?
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
Gladys! Stop it!
So help me, Gladys.
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Nothin' too showy!
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Oh! What is it?
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Uh, Gladys?
What!
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
Enid ate a whole pan!
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Harold!
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
He should be king!
And wear a crown and everything.
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
The king can do no wrong!
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
The king can do to wrong!
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
Here I am, Father.
Take a letter.
Who to?
My dear President...  read it back...
"My dear President"...
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
"My President"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
"My"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
"My dear"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Is that all?
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Here I am, Father...
Send for my car...
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
But you're my father -
About - thirty-four seconds.
Father...
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
Yes, sir.
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yes -- why?
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
What's the matter with you?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Hey you!!
Have you got a license?
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
What kind of a dog is he?
Well - what is he now?
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Half watch dog?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
What do you whistle?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
I don't want him.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
He only weighs ten ounces --
That was for you.
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
Oh no, I can't do it.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Did you shoot the rapids?
No, but I shot some ducks.
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
What other job you got?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
What do I get?
You get half mine and I get half yours.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
Why wasn't I insulted?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Then I demand an apology!
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
She did.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
You told it to me.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
Send in the next girl.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
You no gotta no gun.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight...
I can't do it...
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Anything else?
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Fine.  We gotta him.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
How'm I doing, boss?
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
It must be done right away.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride.
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
That's even a greater honor.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
That's what you think.
You swine!
Give me that again!
You worm!
You upstart!
Then it's war?
Yes.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Bah!!
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
I don't remember.
No, that wasn't it...
Was it -- swine?
No... it was a seven letter word.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
What'll I do with this card?
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Oh, Rufus!
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
Now -- er --
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
Why -- why -- of course.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Take a seat -- you're next.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
But -
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Oh, would you...?
So that's the one you want to marry.
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Uncle, you can't do this!
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
I thought everything was working out fine.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Yes please, two.
One or two?
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
They have noble faces.
I've always thought that myself.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
You won't be long?
Did it go well, darling?
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
What do you mean?
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
Well, these things take time.
John loves the house.
Yes.
You stay with me.
More romances for John?
Hmmm?
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
I found it.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
What are you going to do?
Don't!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
What do you mean?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
What happened?
He fell.  He falls.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
This man belongs in hospital.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
I want my man back.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
You don't own this man!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Good morning, Treves.
Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Yes sir.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Good! How is the patient?
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
I don't understand.
Treves. Well done.
Yes, I think I can.
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
I could easily arrange...
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Well, yes.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Don't we?
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
How are you feeling today?
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
...everyone has been very kind.
What is it, Treves?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
I am very pleased to meet you.
How long has this man been here?
Three quarters of an hour.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
I don't know what I've got.
You never mentioned his mental state.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Oh, no.
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
She's very pretty, your mother.
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
You've never been?
Alas, no.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Tell me about it, please!
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Romance!
Have you read it?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Oh no?
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
How awful for John.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Is he... dying then?
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
You alright?
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
You're English.
Of course! You want out?
Yes.
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
Oh no, my friend...
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
Oh, yes.
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
Yes.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Thank you... very much.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
What's this?
The main spire.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
I'll have to find some more.
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
Yyyess.
Yyess.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Yes!
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Yes.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Hello...
My name is...
My... name is...
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
Righteousness...
Righteousness for his namesake.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
...Yes potatoes... but...
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
You did not ask me.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
Good evening. How are you feeling?
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
This... is my new home?
Yes.
The hospital?
How long will I stay here?
You look splendid, John.
Thank you very much.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
That's a canopy, John.
Ohhh...
How is your tea, John?
Oh yes.
Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Your mother?
Good morning, John.
Good morning.
When will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? When will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? When will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
Yes, John?
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
You want a dressing bag, John?
Yes, John.
You did this for me?
Yes.
My home.
Is it the one you wanted?
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Yes, very soon.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Yes John?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
No, John, not one that I can see.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
Fine.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
I've heard.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Won't come out, eh?
No, he's very upset about something.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Yes sir.  What's that?
A dressing bag.
Yes. John wants it.
A dressing bag?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Well...
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
HE'S GONE!
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Are you the proprietor?
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Pardon me?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Ah! It's my father!
Who, Father?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
Well... where is he?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
It's your fantasy...
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
WHAT did you say?
I said welcome.
WELCOME?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
Please! Please! What are those?
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
What's the matter?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
What?
WHY?
Yes.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
What was she like?
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you LOVED her all the same...
We never went to bed together.
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
"The fifth one this week"!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
Five this week; how many the week before?
We mustn't let him land!
Who?
Halfdan the Black.
Just give me a hand.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
No!
I'll bring it back.
Erik. You don't understand.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
But you don't realize....
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
Of course.
Do you believe I love you?
I... but I...
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Yes -- I believe you do.
The second note.
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
Then I shall come too.
No... no...
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
But --
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
How do we know this is the way?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
I shouldn't have come.
I see the world.
Is it night or day, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
No... we don't...
How?
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Would you like us to sing to you?
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
REALLY?
Really.
No.
We're just not a very musical nation...
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
No.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
Why?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Don't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Is there something the matter with it?
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Yes... oh, yes...
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.
Shut up.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
You don't love ME.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
What -- rape?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
What?
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
About raping me?
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Scream.
Ah.
Aaagh! Rape!
Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
I didn't mean to!
You told them I raped you -- why?
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
What a stupid idea.
Why?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Is THAT Odin?
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
"But" what?
But...
What are you talking about?
It's Halfdan the Black!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
How deep IS the ocean?
Let's hack her to pieces.
What's wrong with making friends?
That's terrible!
Halfdan the Black's here!
I know!
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
What?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
You talking piffle, son?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Who have you been talking to?
It's always the women that start the trouble.
She got me thinking...
I... I... KILLED her...
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
I want to die...  No, I don't!
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Slower! In... Out...
Faster!
What are YOU doing here?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
SHUT UP!
Look, the sky is blue...
It's magic.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
What did he say?
You must help us.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Why should WE care?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
But you're the Gods!
You mean we'd be dead?
Thank you VERY much indeed.
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
Row!
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
A magic dishcloth.
Weren't we supposed to?
I've got you!
You'll be sucked down too!
There is another way.
Who gets killed?
You need to say a bit more than that!
What's the matter with them?
Just say something cheerful.
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Wait, Erik!
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
What do you think?
Well, what else do we do?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his!
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
What are you talking about, Erik?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
But HOW?
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Look, I bagged it last week.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
I AM one, Dad!
ROW!
She hasn't got any.
Hy-Brasil?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Sven!
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye, Leif.
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
You will wait?
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
What's all the panic about?
It can't do you any HARM...
What do we have to do?
How did he do that?
Do what?
He hasn't.
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
You're wasting your time.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Same thing, isn't it?
You know, my son, our lord said...
Your lord.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Are you all right?
No, I'm not.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
I know. I know.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
He used to puke in his sleep.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Aaagh!
Let me go, Sven.
What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Well! Come on!
Who's that?
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
What?
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Get away, Snorri.
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
Can't make enough swords!
Can't make enough axe-heads!
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
My brother blacksmiths!
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
YOU do it!
Relax!
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
Help!
Help!
Shut up!
She knows it was our fault!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
You've lost your mind.
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
Made by YOU, Loki!
It's a tradition.
I know, Dad.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
You went berserk...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So did your father...
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I must only let the red rage...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
Not now, Sven...
I must KILL! Kill!
KILL! KILL!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Well, of course he is!
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
Well, go on! Go berserk!
He drove me mad!
Easy, Dad!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Dad!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Well... I'm game.
Shut up.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
No... he's not... not... there...
And you've got BOTH axes?
Yes, Mother.
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mum.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
No, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
You weren't supposed to see that.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
Thanks, guys.
Yeah.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
I did. You said, things were fine.
I remember.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Yeah, you told me that later.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
Shit. The last time I saw you.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
And I just liked you so much.
No, it was lovely.
May I help you?
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
How are you today?
Okay, I guess.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
You were not.
Come over after I'm done here?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
You rat.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
In the room?
Oh, baby, what's going on?
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
Come up to Boston with me?
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
I'm so excited. Yay!
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
What's wrong with me?
How are you today?
Okay, I guess.
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Why?
Why what?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
It's okay, really.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Rockville Center.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Really? Because --
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
I don't have one.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I like it.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I can't remember.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
I don't really know how --
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
I'm sure you would.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
I'm Joel.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound?
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
I'm not nuts.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
Okay.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Yes?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
That's okay.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Probably see you at the book store.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
It's okay.
Where do you live?
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
I'm not a stalker.
You know Wilmont?
Yeah.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
So you like bookstores, huh?
I like to read.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Sort of, um...
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
What?
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Take care.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Um --
You like that?
Very much.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I don't know.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
It's pretty.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
I'm fine.
Ready for another?
What do you want to hear?
You pick it.
You just say. I'm not really --
Well, I should probably get going.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
No. I --
Thanks.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Yeah?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Yeah, I guess.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Thanks.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Yeah.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Yeah.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
No.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
No, not at all.
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Oh, yeah.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
That's scary sounding.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I think so.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Okay.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You should stay.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
You'll call me, right?
Yeah.
When?
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
Yo ho ho!
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Let me drive you home.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Where are you going?
I want to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
What?!
I don't want to talk about this here.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
Oh, thank God. It's going.
So, um --
You're drunk.
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
No, it isn't that.
I want to know you.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Joely...
Yeah, Tangerine?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
No.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
Oh?
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
What if you hide me?
What do you mean?
I'm right here.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
There's this guy!
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
Really? Is he cute?
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
Joel!
Happy Birthday.
I scoured the city for it.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
This is our first "date" date.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Naomi, I guess.
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Egad, were you horrified?
Right. Something black though.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
I dropped you off after. You said --
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
I told her today I need to end it.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Yeah?
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Well, you're married.
Not yet. Not married.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Probably.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I know.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Hi there.
You said...
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
You know what I did.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
Oh God, how horrid.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
Yeah, like that.
I know.
What do we do?
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
yeah?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Okay.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I think she's great.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
I think, before.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
I wish we did. You married?
Um, no.
Male or female?
Female.
Cool.
What are you doing?
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
I knew.
It's dark.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
I think we should go.
So go.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
What if you stay this time?
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Bye, Joel.
When?
Tomorrow?
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
I think I should go back.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Make love?
Have sex. Y'know --
Oh, um...
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
That's okay. I --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Hey, Joel --
I'm nervous, too.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
Says you were a bully...
A bully? Moi?
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
I don't know.
Doesn't sound like me.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
I can't stop thinking about you.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Oddly enough, I do.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I guess so.
Yeah?
I probably got the same thing as you.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
It's true.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
Hi, it's Joel.
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
You must have been crazy.
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
Hi.
How's it going?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I just got in.
That's me.
It was snowing.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I might be making a mistake.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
It's them.
I should maybe talk to you.
Clementine.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
So then she just stops calling.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
How's the chicken?
She's so sexy.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Naomi.
Okay. I wish you could come.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Clementine.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Well... I did.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
You have to stop this!
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Yours?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
So what's going on, Joel?
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
What?
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Hi.
Hi.
How was it?
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
So you don't mind?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
I hope you get your work done.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I'm sorry.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Oh! Great. That's great!
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
So you think the dissertation will get published?
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
We'll speak soon.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Yeah. Cool.
Very cool. Trippy.
Definitely!
Boo.
Sorry. I just --
It's just... y'know... I mean...
I know. Anyway --
See you later, alligator.
'kay.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
It's freezing out.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
We haven't checked.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Yup.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
Yeah.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
It's stopped.
What?
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Where?
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
Well, what should we do?
I don't know! I just said that!
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
No way. I can handle this.
He's coming?
You better go.
Hey.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
And after that?
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Oh.
What do you want, Stan?
What's this?
I know what it is.
Then why did you ask me?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Howard, your one o'clock.
Mary...
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Thanks.
Okay, we're back in.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
How do you mean?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Is that Nietzsche?
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Alexander Pope?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's no big deal.
That's lovely.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
We can't do this.
What, Howard?
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have an abortion.
It was a mutual decision.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Stan? What's going on?
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Well, where was Patrick?
He went home sick.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
Mary. What are you doing here?
I tried that already.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Oh, hi.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
Does that help?
It's an apartment.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Yeah?
Just wanted to let you know.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
You can if you want.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
This one's history. Moving on...
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
What's your bartlett's?
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
I know who you are.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
Clockworks.
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
Siwash, huh?
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
What do you believe in then?
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
I'm staying with the Countess.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
I don't.
You don't?
Where are the others?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
About...
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
You're political, then?
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwet�kame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
What is Debbie's position?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
That's Jellybean!
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
No, I guess not.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
Extraordinary!
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
How does she like what in bed?
What do you think?
Well.... er...
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Whose fault was that?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
What guy?
I'm cold.
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
What are you doing?
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
I have to go, Julian.
Why? Why do you have to go?
Going north?
Thanks.
Are you in show business?
I was a successful model once.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
So now you're bummin' around?
Yep.
Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.
You're the best?
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
Whooee!
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
Tired...
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
Bonanza Jellybean?
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
Your ranch?
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
A job for me?
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
But Countess...
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
I don't know anything about it.
Ballast.
That means top-secret, Cooper.
I can see why they sent you along.
You still need the rope? I thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
...do you copy?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Holy shit...
Justin?
Time to play Spam in the can.
Okay, listen up. As you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. Dr. Weir, this is: Starck, navigation; Smith, pilot, Justin, ship's engineer --
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
From what?
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
We have a man down...
But Justin...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
Will it work?
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
What?
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
It's holding... She's holding...!
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
What?
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
No, he didn't.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Is that an offer?
What's happening?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
How? The Bridge is gone.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Can you shut it down?
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
What...?
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
Trauma.
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
How is he?
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
What is it?
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Do you hear it? Right there.
Hear what?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
What happened?
Please...
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Please... kill...
What's happening...?
What's wrong?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
His peritoneum has ruptured...
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
Thank you.
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
Does he know that?
What's on your mind?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
What, Justin, what shows you?
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
What does?
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
How do you know all this?
You've reached the First Containment Seal. The engineering decks are on the other side.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Justin, finish your sweep.
Patch me through to him.
Justin.
...I don't want to die...!
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
This is Weir.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
What's the hold up?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
We've got pressure.
Jesus its huge.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Peters is right, no one's here.
I can see the hatch.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
I found one.
Alive?
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
...how's the client?
Can anybody hear me...
Skipper...
Peters...
...you okay?
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
That's a negative, Starck.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
What does it say?
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
That is not acceptable --
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
I can see that, what're they for?
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
Any survivors?
No one?
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
Yes.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
It's complicated...
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
What about it?
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
It's 2041...
Explanation?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
You said this ship creates a gateway...
Yes...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I don't know...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I don't know...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
We're leaving.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Don't... don't do this...
What about my ship?
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
You... You can't do that!
You can't leave. She won't let you.
Your eyes...
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Weir is dead.
Then who the fuck are you?
What are you?
You know.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
I'm not the Devil.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
You're lying...!
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
You can't have them. Go to hell.
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
Jesus...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Yes, sir.
We've got some weather.
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
It is now.  We're locked in.
Captain Miller...
Do we have enough time for a weld?
We don't have time to fart.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
But...
Captain Miller, you copy?
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Sir.
Thank you.
Captain, we got a problem.
Now what?
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Skipper...
What is it, Smith?
Smith, get out of there...
Come again, Skipper?
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
No, no, we just got her back together...
Where is it, where is it...
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
Radiation interference?
That's an affirmative.
Everybody okay?
We're all here.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
How much oh-two do we have?
Oxygen is not the problem.
Carbon dioxide?
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
What about the life readings you picked up?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
What's causing the readings?
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Maybe one of the original crew?
No. It was someone else.
Who?
Miller...
What is it, Starck?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
Go ahead.
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
Miller, come in...
What's going on in there, Starck?
What?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
I'm on my way, Starck.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
Weir can't be alive.
I'll do it --
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
...repeat, we're armed...
Weir.
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
He served on the Goliath.
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
Claire...
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Can you see a body?
No. I saw nothing.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
There's no one in the corridor but us.
He's engaged the override.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Keep him talking.
Almost got it.
We have to do something, oh God...
You got any coffee?
It's cold.
Hey...
Where is she?
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
What the hell is that?
The safety circuit's failed!
What?
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing...
If they are, they're screening their calls.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
What happened to his eyes?
Explosive decompression.
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
Get them back --
What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever.
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
How?
A straight line.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Do they have pressure?
What is it?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Claire is your wife?
Yes.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
What are you doing?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
What is it?
The forward airlock.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Relax, it's casual.
Those yours too?
We're going to have to work on your touch.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I mean...
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
You look like an eighties rock band.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
It's easy for you to be patient.
Where is Reed?
What are you doing here?
I'm worried about you.
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
I'll be watching over you.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
Ben?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
I can't take this.
What about his first born?
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
Five times.
I had it at four.
Isn't that your speech?
He's made a few changes.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Are you alright?
What the --!
Ben. Are you okay?
We had a tough year.
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
It's about to be a broken face.
Ben --
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Where... where am I?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed?... Sue?
What's wrong with me?
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Hey! That's a prototype!
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
And they're changing into...
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What do you mean "complete"?
What?
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
And where do we think we're going?
You're hot!
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Me like-y.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
You're on fire!
Not this again --
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with that?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Back it down, Johnny!
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
But all these people...
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Apparently I can disappear.
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Stop it.
What is that thing?
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You're really cramping my style here.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Sweet.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
I'm driving.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
You two need a time-out.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
What are you doing --
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
And if he's not...?
They're ready for you, sir.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Then what is it?
Leonard, how's the feed?
How's the IPO?
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
Feeling better?
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh... good.
Which was?
For science.
What? What do you mean you --
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What?
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
That's what we're here to find out.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
Are you kidding?
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
What are you doing?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And reverse the mutations --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
Of course. Of course.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You were?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
Why didn't you say something?
I can... make it work.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben's still out there --
Not until Ben is back inside!
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this.
Ben did this?
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
What are you doing here?
But I'm not done with the machine --
It's just business.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I understand the business reasons.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What are you doing?
Raising the shields.
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
You said it was urgent.
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Please don't make this personal --
Oh, I think you already have.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
You want to work at Carl's?
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Of course.
How much did they cost?
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Something happened to them, mon.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Totally.
I can't find it, mon!
It's the first door on your left!
On the ledge?
First door on your left!
Easy, mon.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
This is how I dress all the time.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
No. I want my money back right now.
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Hi, Brad.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
They're not home yet.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Where did you hear that?
Well... it's true.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Why?
I don't know. I was just curious.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
I didn't say that.
Are you still a virgin?
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Does Mom know you have company?
See you later.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
No.
Any problems?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
They were left over from the last shift.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Yes, sir.
Dad says you have to get up!
Leave me alone!
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Leave me alone.
Jeff you have company!
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Get a ride with somebody.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
I don't know.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Well...
Pick a suit.
Are you really a virgin?
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
You're a really good kisser.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
You first.
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Hey, Mike?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
What's wrong?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I didn't see you this morning.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
What's going on?
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Take that back.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
We've got to get an abortion?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
It's definitely your mama.
All right... where did you see her?
She's in my biology class.
No.
Did you get her name?
No. It's too soon.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
I would. Yeah.
Really?
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
Hey, Rat.
Yeah?
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Yo.
Damone. It's Mark.
Mark. What happened to your date?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Damone, are you there?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Damone! You come here?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Well, I've gotta be running.
Poor guy.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
No Damone. I don't understand.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Are you Linda Barrett?
Yes.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
And they don't call my parents?
Not if you're over sixteen.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
How've you been?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
Who's that?
Are you going to ride that wave?
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
I thought he was out of town.
He is.
Seen the new Playboy?
Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
What the fuck is this guy doing?
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother's car!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
Just be glad you're all right.
My brother is gonna shit.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
That's him! He did it!
How's it going.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
What should I do?
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Should we buy a frame for that?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
So what did you do?
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Really?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
He was hot, wasn't he?
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
No way! He just called him a dick.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
What's the big deal?
Well I never did it.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
Was it great?
You'll always remember your first time.
It was nice.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
Climax together.
Does that ever happen?
No. But it's a nice idea.
How long does Doug take?
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
What do you think it is?
It couldn't be.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
What?
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
That little prick.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
That little prick.
I paid for it and everything.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
What do you want?
I want romance.
Not coming? What happened?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Sometime?
Yeah, like maybe never.
But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Dartmouth?!
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
What class?
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Can I come in?
Mr. Spicoli?
You just ripped my card in two!
Yes.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
I couldn't make it in time.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
You better save some for me, you swine!
Mr... Mr. Hand.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
I don't know. I guess so.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
You look like you could still be in high school.
What can I get for you tonight.
Thanks for picking me up.
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
Thanks. So do you.
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
How about the point?
The point sounds fine.
It's very warm out tonight.
Are you really nineteen?
I think I better take you home.
What about those other guys you live with?
Is this your first time?
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
We keep them.
You keep them.
What's your other question?
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Do you know what you want?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Are you all right?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
I had a really nice time tonight.
Do you want to come inside?
Aren't your parents asleep?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Where's your brother?
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Do you really have to go?
Where's Mike today?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham?
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
I made a fool of myself.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
What about the notes?
Hi, Mark.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Really?
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Are you ready to order here?
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Anything to drink?
Two Cokes.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Let's have lunch!
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Killed?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Crying? Why was she crying?
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Rum and ice, please.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Naked!?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
Dobermans don't talk.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Naw!
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
What happened? What did they do to her?
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
A major!
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Naw! Not a major.
He wanted the pineal gland.
Really?
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
What do you mean by that?
Las Vegas.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Oh, my God!...
This is my granddaughter...
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
Hell, no!
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
What?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
"One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
...and we're chock full of that!
Damn right!
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
How long do I have?
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds!
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
Shoot it.
What are you talking about?
That's good...
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Why?
Jesus creeping shit!
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Not much. Why?
I have to go.
GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
Can we make it?
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk.
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
Where'd you get that knife?
What limes?
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
What tape?
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
How about a check?
I want that fucking radio!
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Jesus.
Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
The cops?
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
You degenerate pig!
WELL? What are your plans?
Lucy.
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
NO! Stop talking like that.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Like big lizards.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Lucy is looking for you.
Me?
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
It's gone too far.
Adrenochrome...
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
Where'd you get this?
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
Some of what?
Extract of pineal!
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Right!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yes!
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
The airport is over there!
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
You'd pay me for that?
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
May I see your license.
Could I have that, please?
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
In that case, maybe she can help.
What?
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
Spare me.
Stop!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
We can't risk letting them in.
Careful.
We should go! We should go right now!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
They'll be back.
You know where it is?
We'll meet in three hours?
Where are you two going?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
Where is everyone?
IS IT CLEAR?!
Yeah.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
I don't think you should...
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
Who the hell would you call?
We shot a skunk.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
I think I know where a CB is.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Oh!
You got something better?
We'll be food, dickheads!
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
And the rest of 'em?
And that's how I ended up here.
So, your husband ditched you?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
They're right here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
What tunnel? Where?
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Where's the tunnel?
We just smeared a skunk.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
You seem mighty collected about this.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Fuck you too.
Scared?
No. You?
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
Ohhh.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Just an observation.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Why don't you go check it out?
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
You weren't helpin'.
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
Well then I guess we should just give up.
We're better off.
Come on!
What now, Geronimo?
Why do you take shit from him?
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your brother, huh?
Yep.
I'm in.
We're going to get help.
We gotta try.
We gotta be close.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
What's in the back?
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
How are you holding up?
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Oh.
What is this?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Oh, no.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Really?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
But --
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Um-hmmm.
You wanna see, baby?
Sure.
How much you got?
How much you got to see the show?
What? Really?
My husband...
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
He only shot you once.
Huh?
Will these boards hold?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
What?
What?
What do you mean what?
What's going on between you two?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Four door?
Two.
Open?
Covered.
How many?
Holds four.
Max?
Seven.
Seven.
Keys.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I wouldn't do that, son.
I'll go with ya.
Welcome back.
They were all over the place.
Look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
Bullshit.
Clever fuckers.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Got 'cha!
'Eh, Chief?
Fine, Chief.
Gimme the keys.
NO, but I will lock you in.
What?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
What?!
Move slow and move quiet.
Move it!
Shit!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Hurry!
SHIT.
COME ON!
Yeah, maybe.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
HELP MEEE!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Am I too heavy for you?
OH JESUS!
Well, maybe they migrate?
Hey!
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Yeah, I'll go.
Let's move.
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
What's wrong?
DON'T!
Let's wait it out.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
And the last one is the...
Okay, well that's something.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Hold it!
Let's go!
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Go! Go!
Not without you!!!
Oh my God... What is that?
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
You know you don't have to do this.
I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
We all have to be strong, right?
Her name is Charlie.
Oh...
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
I'll do anything to help.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
We should stick together out there.
Did we make it?
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Um, well...
Are you lying to me?
Well...
What did we say about lying?
I'm not lying.
Well... come on.
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Frances?  Oh no.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
What're you doing?
Putting on my armor.
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
'Forgive'...? For What?
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Excuse me, sir?
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Who's this?
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
I guess so, sir.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Thank you --
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
You know what I mean.
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
I'm not!
You're afraid!
I'm not!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Good, good. Give them that.
Madam...?
Okay, but come here first.
Huh.
The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see --
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
Hello, Harold.
Frances.
Where's Clifford?
What's up?
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
Who?
An actress.
A rich actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
I know, but --
What does Clifford say?
Right now we have to be practical.
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
In my eyes, officer.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
Get your clothes on.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Get your clothes on, lady --
GET OUT!
You learn your lines?
Sort of.
There've been some calls.
Claire?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Fired?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
...Yes.
Without me.
Showdown.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Dick, we need some time apart --
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dick...
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
What night?
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
All square, Doc.
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
I know you believe that.
...Don't you?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
We'll get you home, Frances.
This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
But I'll never win that.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Really?
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Were you an alcoholic?
No.
Were you a drug addict?
Thank you, Ralph.
Bye, baby.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
Thanks, Dad.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
I didn't have much to do with it.
You wrote it, didn't you?
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
I know.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
What do I do, Dad?
You really want to go?
Of course.
And you think it's worth all this?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
...So what do you think?
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and...
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Please, Francie...
Are you... are you hungry?
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
Bread?
Thank you.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
I'm going back to the hotel.
Good.
See you next weekend?
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Kurt!
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
But, Kurt, I...
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Oh, Kurt!
Name?
Age?
Fifteen.
Address?
I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
You can always come see it in London.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I wouldn't miss it.
Are you an actor?
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Are you really serious? About acting?
Why?
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
You sound as if you hate it.
Aren't you ever going back?
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
They'll mend.
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Just one minute...
Don't touch me.
Okay then...
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Not me. But other people seem to.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Yeah, well --
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Whattaya mean?
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Harry.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
How'd I look?
Enh.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
What?
Quietly.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
What happened to him?
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
...So you think I should go.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
You don't know what you want.
What?
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
How ya doin', Farmer?
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
Kaminski.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
What?
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Oh no...
Jesus.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Harry... I met someone.
Serious, huh?
Yeah.
Well, the studio told me not to.
Is that why you did it?
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
You're telling me.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
The hell you will, Harry York.
Don't start, Farmer.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Calm down, Frances.
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
What's left of my blood.
Think I'll have a glass.
Nice joint. Can you afford it?
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
What for?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
I took the early rounds.
I'll bet.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
No, Harry, I can't --
And?
Take a walk, pal.
Oh my God, I look awful.
Evening, gorgeous.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
I should've known...
What?
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
That's right.
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Whattaya think you're in now?
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Huh?
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
You know something, Harry?
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
What's that?
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
What a man!
To quarter-horses.
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
Huh?
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
What's that?
It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
You give up on her?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Frances, You're crazy.
Anyway... if you need me...
Who?
Frances, it's me, Harry?
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Where to?
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
I don't know.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Why do you say that?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
No.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
That would be okay.
Pretty morning.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
And no people.
Where you goin'?
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
What'd you do?
...Is that not true?
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Did you expect him to look you up?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
Fine!
What happened? Who're you?
Who're you?
I live here.
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
What?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
That's me, Clifford.
I'm not!
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
'But how do I know you love me?'
Your big speech?
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
How's it sound?
The speech? Real good.
You got it.
Mama...
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
Yes, Ma.
But they're using you!
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
I don't care.
It's okay.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Mama, what's...
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Why are these all opened?
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Then why did you bring them?
It's your fan mail, little sister.
You kill me, Mama.
What?
Well, who have we here...?
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
I think I need a little air.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
Where are you going?
How long will you be?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
At one. Promise?
Say you promise.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Yes, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Don't... talk crazy.
Mama...?
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
No!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Mama, shut up!
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
Where are you going?
I'm going out!
You're not going anywhere!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Oh, just leave those things for now.
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
But what --
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Excuse me.
Yes...?
Don't I know you?
I don't believe so.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Oh! Are you really?
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
Please sit down...
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
I see.
And what's that?
Normal. Average.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
...Did you really say that?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
Stay calm, please.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
I'll have someone show you to your room.
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
What?
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
You what?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Huh?
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
Frances, I'm warning you...
Symington says...
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
No!
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
No!
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
No! No!
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
Yeah?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
You're kidding.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
What?
You were with him at the end.
Yes.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
What kindness?
Nice.
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
Better that way... for me.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
It can't be as bad as that.
Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes. Very close
People can be kinder than you think.
Come warm yourself if you like.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Kill me and have done with it.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Your crime... as well as mine.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Materials. Nothing more.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
I don't know.
What can I do?
There is something I want.  A friend.
Friend?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
And if I consent?
Soon?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
Why... her?
What is this?
A brain. Extremities.
You will honor your promise to me!
I will not! Kill me now!
She's beautiful.
She's not for you.
GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE!
Poor William! What indignant tears!
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
You dance so beautifully together.
Must've been a terrible row.
Nothing. Still nothing.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
So have I
I should go. I should leave today.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Are you all right?
He always was opinionated.
What does it say?
Have you seen Willie?
Is he not back yet?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
What kind of God is He to will this?
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
God took her from us.
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.
And you?
I'll have to do better than that.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
I've loved you all my life
This feels... incestuous.
Brother and sister still?
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
Only you.
Our decision. Together.
I give you my soul...
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Victor. I love you,
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I've no choice
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
I thought I'd never see you again!
What sort of task?
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
So do I.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
Why the change? What about your work?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
It is
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Brother and sister no more.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
Victor!
It's going to ram us.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
A warming wind.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
No. But someday.
Professor?
I was just clearing my throat.
Henry Clerval.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
Do you really think I'm mad?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
Can you think of a better reason?
Quite a few.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
Now you've got him started.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
Only you would think of that!
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
They just caught the man who did it.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
You're making a scene!
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
You can't. Death is God's will!
I resent God's monopoly.
That's blasphemy!
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
I've been preoccupied.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
How much longer?
This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Yes? And?
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
A... week?
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Is that your diagnosis?
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
You've been going round-the-clock?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
No. They don't.
Quite a place.
For what?
What happened up there?
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
I have always loved him.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Philosophical?
Paracelsus?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Professor Waldman.
Victor, explain yourself.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Electricity.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Why?
Re-configure the leads?
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Are you a physician?
How is it you come to be here?
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Ah. An explorer.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I heard.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You know of it?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
Do you share my madness?
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
Who are you?
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
The killer is still out there.
We should go now.
What'd you see?
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
Tomorrow is another day.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Good night, Alice.
Cabin B is ready.
You draw very well.
Any particular reason?
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Next Friday.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
Alice? The others show up?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
Oh, my God...
Filmmaker.
It still hurts?
What'll you do when you leave here?
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
You can only do what you can do.
How the... did he get in there?
Trouble?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
Good point.
Help you clean up?
I don't hear it anymore.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.
I'll go take a look.
Where?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Jack?
Marcie?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
What's the matter with it?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
How come?
I'll be along.
I'm sorry.
Sure.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
You said we were special.
You know what I said, though.
I wouldn't know.
Claudette...
Somebody'll see.
Somebody's there, Barry.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Let's go back, Barry...
What the hell?
Give me a hand?
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You saved my life.
Thanks.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
What is it?
Roll him over!
Chance to get even?
You just had some lucky shots.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
I don't believe you...
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
Holy shit...
What hath God wrought?
That was the telephone.
Ha!
Ow!
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Jack?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
How about our last jay?
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I love you.
What about Neddy?
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Don't call him.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
It's just a dream.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Are you wet?
Mmmmmmmph?
Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...
Umhummmmph.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Whassamatta?
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Cowboy.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
You okay?
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
I got to.
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
One night on the town.
I mean...
That's thirty percent.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Have to drop you here, Steve.
Good luck.
Another coincidence.
How many with you?
Just my son and I.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
You said it was just you and your son.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Have you ever been there before?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
Twenty-eight.
You like the car?
I said new, this is an '90.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
So do I just follow you?
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
Why do you want to stop?
I'm exhausted.
What's this guy's problem?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
Have you forgotten about your sister?
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
What about Kate?
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
He's running the show.
You don't believe in suicide.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Why did they block the door again?
What's your name?
Jacob.
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
What's this about, money?
It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
On the dresser.
Not a chance.
Come again?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Sorry, I need everybody.
Yes.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
Who's this?
My wife.
Where is the little lady?
She's dead?
Yes, she is.
How'd she die?
Auto wreck.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Died instantly?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Is this real?
Yes.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Real McCoy.
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
Why'd ya quit?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
Yes.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Yes.
No, I didn't.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
You won't let him touch her?
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't try to escape and you'll get us across the border.
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
I don't have the slightest idea.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
Then?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Who else?
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Why are you so agitated?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
He backed down.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
What did you call me?
To your family.
Now, is your shit together?
Okay, does anybody here know what's going on?
You too, preacher?
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
In the Winnebago.
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Did he...?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
I promise.
It's the bitterest of pills.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
That happens, you'll get it back.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
What do you think Mom would say?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It's a flop house.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
About two hours from now.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
I promise.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Not good enough, swear to God.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
I'm going for 'em!
No!
What's going on?
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
Where are you taking us?
Mexico.
What's in Mexico?
What?
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Do what?
What you said to me in the room.
What did I say?
Creepy guy.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Yes.
Do you believe me?
Yes.
Yeah.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Yeah, we got a bible.
You're gonna let us go?
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
Are you okay?
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
I'm really sorry.
We have to go back for Daddy!
Daddy's dead.
Watch my back!
How many bullets left, kid?
Not many.
Should I use the last bullets on us?
I'm sorry.
See ya.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
-- you got your microwave --
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
-- see this, television!
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
Hot goddamn day!
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Not even for lunch?
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
Whatsamatter?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Were you giving that pig signals?
He says you were scratching.
I never said help us!
Whiskey!
You can't come in here.
What dya mean?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Best in Mexico.
What the fuck was that about?
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Start the car.
Richie? You okay?
Yeah?
Gotcha!
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
No.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
No.
How's it feel?
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
All I'm saying --
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Sight seein'.
What'd ya see?
Cops.
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
How do you know?
Where's the woman?
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
She's in the other room.
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
What?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Richard!
This isn't gonna work.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
What does that mean?
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
This ain't the time, Richard.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Keep your voice down.
This ain't the time.
You okay?
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I don't know, you just passed out.
I did?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Really?
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
What?
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
We are?
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
That's what you think?
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
How?
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
I'm here with you.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
My shit is together.
It don't look together.
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
Yeah.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
Yeah, it's mine.
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
He needs our help!
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
Thank you, ensign.
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
That's what I hear.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Who's "we"?
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
I've been accused of that wish.
The woman I saw you with...
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Don't say my name.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Got it.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Wow...
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Your prerogative, Senator.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Standing right here in my office.
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Of course, but there's more --
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
I'm fine, sir.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Really, I have no problem with --
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
None at this time, sir.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
Oh, really.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Pardon?
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
No, sir.
No, sir, WHAT?
Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
Across the board, sir.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Then good night.
So I'll get a fair shot?
See me, sir?
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
Permission to leave, sir?
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
I'm saying, we're just friends.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
I'm not sure what --
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Sir?  What did he say?
Ah, c'mon...
Fine by me, sir!
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
Entering my scan now...
Smoke her.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
White House boys want a private meeting.
Think I overplayed it?
Yes?
Did you hear?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
Hardly the case, Senator.
"The Lark Report."
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
"Coronado."
California.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Uh, question, ma'am.
Yes, dear.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Can't complain, ma'am.
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Uh, ma'am.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
You know him.
Sounds familiar.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
What changed?
Should probably ask him that.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
You don't know that.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
I'm sure it is.
You'll think about my offer?
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
So she picks the women, we pick the programs.  Seals?
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
Then I suggest we start there.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
No, ma'am.
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Close as I can get, el-tee!
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
I can make this wall without --
Just do it, okay?
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
Come on, Montgomery...
O'Neil?
Sir?
Time.
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
Boat Five -- Wickwire, Cozad, Vinyl, Intagliata, Ayers, and Wise. Lieutenant Wickwire is your senior officer.  Follow his orders to your death.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I oughtta report you.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
The Navy Cross...
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Just a coincidence?
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Chances of recovery?
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
Just like you would be.
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
She's haze grey and underway...
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
So dump on me.
This has nothing to do with you.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Jordan...
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
That bad?
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
Me?  Why me?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I saw an article...
So why are you telling me this?
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
No shortage of suspects.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
"In Washington..."
What?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
So here we are again.  Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Which is guy-speak for...
They're more afraid of you.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Whose orders were those?
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
And how do you know that?
Made it to Week 10 last time.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
Who is it?
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
That's a good story.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
He was married?
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
O'Neil?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Last time I didn't.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I think you look beautiful.
Do you, uh, know...
Sure, sure.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
I'm sorry, O'Neil.  But as class officer, it's my obligation to report all violations.
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
Just askin'
She part of the training?
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
32 feet, six inches!
'Cool?
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
Maybe half.  Not even.
Say again, sir?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
"Dad."
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Should I be afraid?
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
Would you have shot if it was a man?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
That's not right.
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
I think you're the liar.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
No.
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Well, I'm trying to figure out if you're stupid, unlucky, gluttonous -- or some new alloy of all three.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Say again?  How many micks?
Got it.
O'Neil...
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
Clear.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
We're fucked.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
This ain't workin' right!
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Subject?
O'Neil, Jordan.
Thought you two were file-closed.
You knew about us?
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
The first female President?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Women.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
I don't know.  Seems...
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
I take it this file is still open.
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
That's cuz I'm married to you.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Who the hell are all these people?
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Where's Audrey?
What?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Me!? You where the one...
I like that image.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
That why you dumped him?
How long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
He stole my report! That's my report!
You okay?
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
My God. He's going after the nest.
Animal, I can't.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Don't you think we have enough?
Think we can fit up in there?
He's not going to do it.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So you made it.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
Most people don't.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
And you think this creature is one of them?
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
I got pretty close.
...he's pregnant.
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
Nesting?
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
You never said it was off the record.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
What are you doing here?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
Circuits are overloaded.
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
How do you know?
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
Are you okay?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
You'd be surprised.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
My life sucks.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Who is he?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
What the hell are you doing?
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Your old sweetheart?
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Wish me luck!
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
What's it to you?
Can I use some?
What do I get?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Five bucks.
Did you talk with Humphries?
This is not the place...
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Mr. Caiman, you're married.
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
Call me Charlie.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
So have dinner with me tonight.
What?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
You don't understand, I can get us information...
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
We? I don't think so.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Oh, I'm not married.
Really? A girlfriend then?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Not for a long time, now.
Well, I think you're cute.
Hence the radiation.
I'm sorry about all this.
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
Merde!
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
We've secured the doors on both levels.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
They didn't make it.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Have them sealed off.
And how should we do that, Sir?
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
You're fast.
That is our job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
It's Tatopoulos.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
What sample?
That's right.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
Somebody must have seen it.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
What are you suggesting?
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
You gave them the tape?
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
Are you looking for this?
Do I know you?
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
Are you sure? How do you know?
We know.
Why are you telling this to me?
I need you to trust me.
Why do you need that?
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
What's with the chewing gum?
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
I think we should leave now.
It's Raymond.
I understand.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
Well good, that's very... nice.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Just don't.
This is it?
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Is that the bathroom?
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Thanks.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
Don't speak, Quellek.
Come on, old friend...
You WILL go out there.
I won't and nothing you say-
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
God, what an ass.
At ease men.
We've got to stop!
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
About this much.
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
You go first! There's no time!
What?  What?
Nothing.
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
~hex!  Alex, are you oKav?
Yes. Good was done this .....
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
He's a twit!
Settle down, Alex...
What the hell is going on?!!?
He wants to THINK!?
What's happened?
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
Shut up.
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
And note the sucked in gut.
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
He's a miserable twit!
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Alex you can't -just leave.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
You could order something in.
A boy comes to the door.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
Oh my god, It's real.
We heard it the first time!
May I get the check?
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
"Go into the cloud! ...
Alex? Where are you going?
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
I don't know.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
You said "the Commander.
What?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
No I didn't.
He always has to make the big entrance.
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Hi Brandon.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
Oh.  Okay.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
Yes but, we were wondering-
... Yes?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
What's  your name, son?
Brandon.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
It's okay. Listen-
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Okay, we got it.
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Yes...?
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
What does the Omega 13 do?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
What do you mean?
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
But you don't?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
How did you come to that conclusion?
BRANDON!	TIME TO GO!
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
Okay, now. But-
No, wait, are you-
Shit! Go!
Go. They're off again.
Up.
What?  Up?
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
That's It?
Yes?
There is no weather in space.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power?
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Systems register functional.
Systems register functional.
U.... What do you think?
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
... What does that mean?
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
Covalent... Right. So...
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
A hologram...
Never mind, Fred....
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
Right.
No, I'll kill you. .
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
As good as Hopkins?
How do you remember this stuff?
You Okay, Alex?
...The digital conveyor.
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
It's suicide.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
Oh, they're so cute.
I am SO SICK of being right.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
...Okay
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Your last name.
Yeah, what is it?
It's... I don't know.
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
Hi everybody.
More to the left... Stay parallel...
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
We're doing episode 31?
They're gone.
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
Not a clue. You?
We're alive!
~e're alive!
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
It's Jason...
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Only answers to me.
But I'm the Commander!
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
Tell them? About...
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
Hey... Hey where are you going?
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
There's nobody here. Jason...
Jason..
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
JASON...
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Can it be repaired?
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
You're playing your good side.
How does the rolling help, actually?
Clenched jaw...
Jason.. Can you hear me?
Thank God. Are you okay?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
What?  What did he say?
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
Right.
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
Gwen...
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Because it was on the show!
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
That's it, It's go time.
You should have let me hit him.
You know, that's really getting annoying.
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
I heard it too.
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
Closer?  I can try.
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing?
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
You have ten seconds.
Yes.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Stop, please! I don't know!
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
Wait. What did you say?
Explain -
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
We pretend...
We.. We lie.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Home.
You... You mean Earth?
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Theramin.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
But what if Sarris survives?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
Weapons storage...
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
NO, Thank God he has not.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Former Commander?
Commander...
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
"Deception..." "Lies."
Well... Sort of...
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
But there it is!...
A model, only as big as this.
But... Inside, I have seen-
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
But...Why?
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Wh... Where are we?
What's going on?
Excuse me?
Where?
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Do your best, Tommy...
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
What kind of signal?
Anything.
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Okay... On what?
How about the pig-lizard?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
NO NO NO.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Let's do it, Tommy.
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Hold course, Laredo!
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
Find them.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Because they're coming right at us.
Some say that Hessians are invincible.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Over three hundred miles.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
What's your frank estimation of the British?
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
And a French alliance?
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
Arnold!
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Is that a fact.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
The army needs you.
The army can survive without me.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
I hope I never have to believe that.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
Well, George, who were you?
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
While they're strung out?
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
That can't be.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Misunderstood what!?
A lot of years have gone by.
What?  What are you talking about?
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil...
Yes, general?
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
Yes, general.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
No.  I guess.
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
No, my lord.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Yes, my lord.
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
We've got powder but no ball!
How old are you, Captain?
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
I'm so inclined.
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
What are we going to do?
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Yessir.
Sir, I think no such thing.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
What is this?
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
To hell with Arnold...
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
What's your advice, Alexander?
I want to address the officers, all the officers.  Next Friday.  Can we arrange it at the mess?
Yes, I believe so.
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
I'm not sure.
That's why the people trust you George.  Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Who's in command out there?
Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Lafayette is a child!
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
They are... friends of Congress.
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Let's not over do it...
Makes you gag.
Gag on your own invention, then.
Oh, come now...
You think that?
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
Partially...
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
General Lee is detained captain...
Detained by what?
Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Unofficially, General Greene.
Any word from Canada?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here:  our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them.
Colonel Reed...
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
A grand scheme?
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
They help me understand why we fight.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
I... they look both the same.
No, please; an advance on your salary.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
You must be very rich.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
I only meant...
These supplies...?
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
And how rusty are these muskets?
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
I rode here, on my horse.
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
Like flowers after the snow melts.
What is it, Marquis?
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
General Lee, sir!
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Surely you knew this was coming.
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
My God, what?
I'm very aware of that.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
That's right...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
I think I heard that.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
What else?  From Virginia?
Martha... what?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Some things must never change.
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Martha!  For God's sake!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Not today.
I want you to see our hospital.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
We're leaving them?
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
A horseshoer?
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
General Greene?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
What the hell are we doing?
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Well, this must be about something!
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
You know very well who it is that I love.
George, you know I only love you, but...
But not more than your comfort.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
That's a lie!
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
George, I'm sorry.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Where... do those men come from, George?
Africa, of course.
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
Then why are you teaching me...?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
It's the freest land on earth.
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
What are you doing?
Let's get you darker!
You're out of your mind!
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
That's good... who?
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
All people have rights!
Just because they are born?
Yes!
Who says so?
I say!
I see...
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
You hear that?
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
The land here is best for grain and corn.
My daughter, I ask only...
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
Juba was a Numidian.
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
What is this?
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You're kidding me, right?
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
I guess still in the locker.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
You see the paper?
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
Who?
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
What about him?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
You get the money?
No. What's this?
Trade for what?
You get life for kidnapping.
Calm down, Bear...
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
And that's for the airport.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
So you didn't have the key with you.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Not too bad.
So... how many movies you been in?
About sixty.
Where is my nephew?
Your who?
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
You gave him the money?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
He's around someplace.
What's this movie you're doing first?
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
You can talk to me.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
There's Ilona.
Get something going there.
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
She's... young.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Who?
You know how to write one of these?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
That's all there is to it, huh?
I need the money.
What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
Karen? You okay?
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
You know Laurel Canyon?
I'll find it.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Where's Karen?
She's great. Gimme the money.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
You positive about that?
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people �-
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
I'm working on a few things.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
You serious?
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
The airport.
I don't know.
C-18.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Ray Barboni?
Depends. Who's this?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
What three hundred grand?
Hello? You there?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Okay. So who are you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Never heard of him.
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
Or else what?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
What?
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
How'd you get in here?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Why would I do that?
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
Sovereign.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -� I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -� forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Who the fuck are you?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
The man you're steppin' on belongs to me and my partner.
He owes me money.
Get in line, bro.
I don't like waiting.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
You live in Miami?
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.
You're an investor, is that it?
I'm a producer.
You have a card in here?
Your wife a Lakers fan?
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Something shouldn't be there.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
What've you got?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Have we met? I don't recall.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
I'm looking at you.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
That's what I'm doing.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
A marker's like a check, Harry.
I know what a marker is.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
Come on, Harry -� Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
You make movies, huh?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
You just did.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
Keep going.
So he comes to L.A...
That's it? That's your movie?
I said I had an idea, that's all.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
The shylock's the good guy.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You mean, Leo?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
You pack a gun?
Not really.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Ever shot anybody.
Once.
Really? You ever been arrested?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
For a movie?
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
What's it called?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
She looks familiar.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
So what's the problem?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
He drown?
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -�
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Just a thought.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You don't even know these guys.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
What?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Hey, Harry.
Here's your keys, Harry.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Really.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
You have it?
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Who?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
He died.
Personally?
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
What Get Away jet?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Twenty seven hundred.
Yeah. That was a good party.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
We talk different?
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
Martin, look at me.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Like this?
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
Wait. How about this?
How about this?
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
I believe it.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Very nice...
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
What's that?
Compass.
Whatta you think, Chill?
I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Who told you that?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
How'd you know I was here?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
How? By taking my money?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
It's all mine.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
It's not one of these?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
The door from the patio, in back.
You broke in?
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
That's right. Three percent.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
What're you doing here?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Rough day on the set?
...That's what we finally decided.
You saw that one?
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -� which by the way was a better book than a movie -� did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
For any movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Man, can you scream.
"Cotton".
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
You been here the whole time?
I got you a copy of the script.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
I think it's not horrible.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Then you've read it?
Not yet.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
There a part in it for you?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
Sounds fair.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
I want to know.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
Depends, who pays?
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Yeah?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
You thought I was faking?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -�
Harry... My God...
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Why not?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You sure?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
You okay?
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Were you scared up there?
You bet.
You don't act like it?
I'll be right back.
What took you so long?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
That's what the guy said.
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
I told you not to -�
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Hm?
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
What a spectacular view.
I miss Murray, Harry.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
What's wrong?
Be quiet and listen.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I don't have a dog.
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
Harry -�
How did you get in the house?
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
'We?'
Harry -�
Which two?
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
What money?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Really.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Oh, for Christ's sake �-
Lufkin. His... agent.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
A passenger liner. Over.
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
North Island, have you got any additional information? Over.
Roger, North Island. I am tied to the passenger vessel Chimera. And she is afloat. Repeat, she is afloat. Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
You think the extra strain caused it?
How about now?
Sixty pounds.
What? You sure?
That's what it says.
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Fucker!
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Damn mind of it's own.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
Let's not be too hasty.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
What day is it?
I don't know. Tuesday?
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
The turbine blew.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Where from?
What is your first name?
What?
Maureen.
What?
Maureen.
Roger.
Roger?
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Ready?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
This's gonna hurt a little.
What other choices have we got?
Guess I'll just keep working.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
So we kill him?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Smokes?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
A what?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.
Try Wednesday.
Did you?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Dodge.  Dodge.
What?
Get up.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
If you get it back in one piece.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
Mother fucker!
What is it?
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
How long to fix?
Turbine rotor's shot.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Like I always say --
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
Hard to say.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
What about running number two by itself?
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
How long, then?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
How long?
Three, four days.
Goddamit, Dodge.
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
Went aboard.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
Sounds like the hull.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Bodies're too fresh.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
That'd be my guess.
Can't you use something else?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Dodge to Murphy.
Murphy.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
On a passenger ship in 1953?
How do you mean?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
What do you propose?
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
The radio!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
You smashed it!
What?!
Don't lie to me!
What the fuck -- ?
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
Conveniently enough for you.
Yeah.
What the hell happened!
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
If money can buy what he wants.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
You're late.
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Could be a fishing boat.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
You mean, before she sank.
Then why didn't they take it.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
That's what I call a payday.
Coffee.
Stay away. Or else.
Any dizziness?
No.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
You okay?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Go on.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Coffee?
What'd you find up there?
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
She was sailing up north, right?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Nope.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
So what did happen?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Why not call for help?
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Did you see him?
Who?
What guy?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
You sure it wasn't me?
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Got your light?
Murphy to Epps.
Epps.
You just shoot at something?
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
Greer?
He needs a doctor.
How's he doing?
Same. Any luck?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
The ah... the radio's out.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
February first.
The same day she supposedly went down.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Hey.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
What do you think happened on this boat?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
The what?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
Not our mystery guest again.
What, like some kind of ghost?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Showing you what?
What happened.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
That much I think we've already established.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
Murphy to Epps.
Epps, over.
Nope.
Epps? You there?
What do we do with him?
What do you think?
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Over the gold.
They went crazy.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
What happened?
We hit land.
What?
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
You killed them.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
So you killed them?
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Greer to Murphy.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Let the buyer beware.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Yeah.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
Too deep to anchor out there.
Call the Coastguard?
It's funny.
How's that?
Murphy, goddamit.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Morning.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
I heard that.
What now?
We could call for help.
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Greer?
I don't know.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Pretty low all around.
Ho-ly shit.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
How're you feeling?
What happened?
You don't remember?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
You've been out for about a day.
Oh, man.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
Shut up.
It's a Noaa buoy.
A what?
We're still drifting.
He took the shotgun and a light.
Can't find the shotgun.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Leave it.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
I thought you say Tuesday.
Better late than never.
What's this?
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
No, no. You got leak.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Fifteen, at the most.
You're kidding, right?
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Will you get off my back for once?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Who?
Guess.
How should I know?
Someone from the past.
Who?
YES.
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Are you still looking for a job?
Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
What?
Are you going to yell at me?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
But I can't --
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
What are you trying to say?
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
And what can you tell us about this...
Who is this, Enid?
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Did you actually do this painting?
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Uh-oh.
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Hmm.
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
...wow...
So what do you think?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Well, yes...
I...
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Huh?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I didn't check my messages...
Help me what?
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
It's not optional!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
So Josh...
That guy rules!
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Aren't there a million places like this?
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Yeah, right.
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Jesus, look at this guy.
Forget it.
No.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Hi Josh.
Hi.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Hi... what's up?
Are you the one who left that note?
Do you want something to drink?
Why?
What do you mean "why"?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Yeah, right...
Nothing.
Then why do you hate me so much?
When did I say I hated you?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
That's just the way I am!
Yeah, well --
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Oh, hi...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
How long have you been up?
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Why not?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Okay... I promise.
Hi Enid.
Hey Josh.
God, what a bunch of retards...
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
What?
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Why?
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Shut up!
What? Why?
Since when is she an "actress"?
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
How perfect.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Good.
Hi.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Why?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Did you sign up yet?
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
Much later.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
Or maybe not.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Okay, okay!
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
Hi, Al!
I might actually get the pasta special.
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
You can have that one.
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Does Oomie really like this show?
So what should we do?
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
What is this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Look at how cute I am!
Look, that's back when I hated you.
I remember every minute of that party.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
I want to do him!
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
What are you talking about -- who?
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
Which loser?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
You call.
Why do I always have to do it?
You're better at it.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
What does it stand for?
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Look, maybe that's him!
I want to "make love" to him.
SHUT UP!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
What's going on now? What's he doing?
What's he doing now?
Do you think he knows?
Are you sure?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
This is way too creepy.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Gross!
That was truly pathetic.
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
Oh yeah...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Not really...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
What are you talking about?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Just promise you'll do it.
What? How long have you been standing there?
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
We still have to go in there sometime.
It's always closed...
Where are we going?
There he is...
As always.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
JOSH!
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
What was that all about?
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
I didn't get it either.
Ew ... when did you get that?
How about this?
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
I know a party we could go to...
What? Where?!
It's a surprise.
I don't believe you.
I totally, totally hate you.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Give me all your money, bitch!
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Where?
Anthony's II!
No way... when?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
That guy is totally amazing.
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
That rules!
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
But those are our people...
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Like what?
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Which one?
He gives me a total boner!
You're just jealous.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Fuck it. Everything must go!
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Now are you going to get a regular job?
Don't worry.
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
Do you want to do something tonight?
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
Go ahead...
God, you're really obsessed...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Look, we have to get these...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Don't you want nice stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
You're insane.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
What happened to Seymour?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
So should I come over?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
I don't believe you.
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
What? When did you see Josh?!
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
When was this?
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
Great...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
I said "great"...
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Hello?
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
So, whaddya think?
It's fine.
There.
That's all you're bringing?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
What time?
Hi.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Wow... finally.
What about me? Am I not even here?
We're not.
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Nothing.
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Oh my god, what are you guys doing here?
What are you doing here, Melorra?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
Well, we won't keep you.
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
May I ask what you're doing?
Shhh!
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
A what?
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
How much is this?
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
Seymour does.
Who does?
You still interested in that?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
Didn't they tell you?
Tell me what?
Punk rock is over!
I know it's over, asshole, I --
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
That's not even --
Oh, how "punk."
That tape sucked, by the way!
Go die, asshole!
Hi... what's your name?
...are you waiting for a bus?
Yes.
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
You're late, asshole.
Fine, and how are you?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
I did too!
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Hey, where are you going?
That's five hundred dollars.
What?
Five hundred.
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Indian records?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Sure, I guess.
Is this one any good?
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
How much is it?
A dollar seventy-five.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Wow!
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Oops! I dropped it!
NO!!!
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Really? Can I see it?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Good luck...
I'm totally serious!
Yeah, well...
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
What about her? Would you go out with her?
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Every guy has a type!
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
So is that your boyfriend?
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Well are --
Yeah, sure... very funny....
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
I - I'd really rather not...
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
I don't think so...
PLEASE? We have to!
Shh!
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
Relax, Seymour, relax...
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Yes, that would certainly do...
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
What did you tell that girl?
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Jesus...
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
Wow, this is so cool...
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
What, are you a klansman or something?
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
You work at Cook's Chicken?
For nineteen years...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Hey, can I borrow this?
I promise I'll take good care of it.
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Are you okay?
What is that?
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
What, like a girdle?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
That's the spirit!
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Really?
Never...
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Why?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Aren't you going to get that?
Wow!  What was that all about?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
How can you be so sure?
Uh... hello?
Oh, hi...
So, what happened?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
What? You're kidding me...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
Really?
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Well when can we do something?
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
And you like them?
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
...What do you mean?
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
What's up?
Can you at least let me in?
Uh... sure... come in.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What's the matter?
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
Where did you get this?
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
I'm just being realistic.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I hate sports.
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What about Joe?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
What?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
So where would we go?
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I dunno, I...
What do you want?
What do you want?
I-I-I...
God, Dana's going to kill you!
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
I will if you want to.
No... forget it...
Yeah, well... me neither...
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
They're Seymour's.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Where else am I ever going to find another girl who likes Geeshie Wiley records?  She could at least have the decency to call me back.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Please Josh?
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I agree.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Yeah.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
I am.
Talk to us about it...
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
What do we have here, Margaret?
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Right, exactly!
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
She's not at home?
No... they said she was here...
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
Why? What did she tell you?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
That slut!
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Did she say that?
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
What do you mean?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What are you talking about?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
Thank you, doctor.
Seymour?
Yes?
You were contracted to work-
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
No hints, Samuel.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
I am a man of peace.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
Starting now, we attack them.
How; we don't know where they are?
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
You've never built in Africa.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Pleasant journey?
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Don't they, though?
I do need to see Starling.
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
Yes he is.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
Are you running a high fever, man? How could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed? How could you even conceive of it?
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
And it worked?
What?
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
Then why do you stay?
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited.
You don't enjoy killing, do you?
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
You never had it.
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
That's a terrible idea-
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
What if there are complications?-
Go, now.  Such a gentleman.
We have hunted since childhood.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Don't much like them.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site?
Finish your tour?
I couldn't believe it when you said "sort it out." As if it were the most normal thing in the world. "Ho-hum, what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a killer beast this evening, nothing much else going on anyway."
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
Might be exciting for you.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
Shhh.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
What?
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
...one shot...
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
How lucky we are.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
All right- thee second embankment will go there.
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
John, it will not be easy.
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
But you said they were always old.
Second death? Where?-
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
You mean nobody died?
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.
We need to talk.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
Actually, no.
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
That's very considerate.
Have you got it?
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
I can try.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
...misfire... it jammed...
Has it ever done that before?
Think about something else.
Have you ever failed?
Goddammit!
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
But of course yours worked.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and...
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
I'll be bait alone?
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
I'll have to.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Good luck.
Why?
How many do you think they've killed?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
The workers don't get on?
Did it look like this in your mind?
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Nonsense.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Oh yes, I think so.
For you.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
Soon.
You like him, don't you?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
He has children?
Where is it?
Afraid of lions.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
How many cattle?
Four should do it.
Why so many?
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Where do you go next?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
What do you want with my baby?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Everybody has a choice.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
We don't have a relationship.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
What are you working on, Egon?
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Do you ever see him?
Occasionally
How is he these days?
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Does he ever mention me?
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Certainly.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I won't.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
You're also a human being, Frank.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
No, you didn't, Frank.
Okay, that's no problem.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
What do you think?
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
Oscar!  You poor kid!
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
I'll do it.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Good luck.
So this is what you do, huh?
Oh, hello, Peter.
You're really good, you know.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
Good-bye, Peter.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts.  But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
I don't know what to do anymore.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Or we could do that.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Does she know anything about babies?
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
I'm not even good for me.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Maybe I should call Janine.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
That's a terrible thing to say.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Is this the spot?
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
Sorry!
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
Can I help you?
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
That's quite a story.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
What is it, honey?
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Who are you going to call?
Oh migod!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to do that.  It was an accident.
What are you doing up here?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
Well, good night, Louis.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
Too bad for the Moldavians.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I know.
Then why have you come?
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
This is the one that looked at Dana.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Command me, lord.
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
I await the word of Vigo.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
You've got to do something!
Who are they?
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
These boys aren't playing around.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Can I have some of your water?
Get on with it, counselor!
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
You were the one who got me in.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
Egon!
Hello, Venkman.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I'd like to have a stool specimen
What now, Brainiac?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
You were supposed to help me with this.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
That's it?  "I'll be back?"
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
So far so good.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
From where -- Neptune?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Who was that?
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
I'm Egon --
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Is the line sinking?
Rivers of the stuff!
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
What's that?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
I'm Ray --
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
And now you're going to eat it?
This is what you do with your spare time?
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
Like a goat on garbage.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
What kind of tests?
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
Did you find anything at Dana's?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
What happened?
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
My Fault!
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
My great-grandparents were Swiss.  I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
What's your story, Pete?
Ready?
I'm ready.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Does it have any favorites?
You got a flux and a half.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Are you telling me how to drive?
No, I just thought --
Are you all right?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
She's moving!
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
I don't care what you say.  This could be a major Christmas gift item.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Tell him about the toaster.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
And pure --
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Wonder what?
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
Aren't you glad we waited?
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Now where are you going?
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Uuuuuuugh!!
Ready?  What is it?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
No.  They're just coming to me.
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Eight o'clock?
Oh, Dana, it's you ...
Hi, Louis.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Hi, Louis.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Is that your professional opinion?
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
That's a violin concerto.
No?  What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.
That's too bad.
What?
Well, let's check it out.
You're quite a housekeeper.
I told you, I ...
Damn!
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
All right.  What do you want to do?
I think I should spend the night here.
Out!
I want to help you.
I'll scream.
Don't scream.
Then leave.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Goodbye.
Great rehearsal.
You heard it?
You're the best one in your row.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Who's the stiff?
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
You must have gotten the last copy.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
He is the Destructor.
Do you want this body?
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
I want you inside me.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
Really!  Is it gone?
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
That is one speedy mutt.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
What's that got to do with it?
Did you see it?  What was it?
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Print is dead.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Is that a game?
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
I think it's the food of the future.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Die in what sense?
In the physical sense.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
I want you to have this.
What is it?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
I don't believe in luck.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
The EPA?  What's he want?
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Has this ever happened before?
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Can I help you?
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Great!  How's it going?
Are you Peter Venkman?
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
You could say that.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
In a storage facility.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Yes, it would.
And may I see this storage facility?
No, you may not.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
May I please see the storage facility?
Why do you want to see it?
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
That's "Peck!"
All right.  What is it?
A square?
Yes.  I don't like this.
Two wavy lines?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Yes?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
What on earth gave you that idea?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh!  You're here.
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
I'm always serious.
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Did you see anything?
Something was definitely here.
What?
Don't cross the beams.
Why not?
Trust me.  It will be bad.
What do you mean "bad?"
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
What is it?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
I agree.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
She said he was "the Destructor."
Who?
Gozer.
You talked to Gozer?
What now?
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
Life is just a state of mind.
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Sorry, Buddy!
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
It's working!
Set entry grid.
I've got to sleep.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
What happened??!!!?
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
What do you mean by "seen?"
What is it?
I told you it's real.
What do we do now?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
For what purpose?
You'll never regret this, Ray.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
How was your date?
They will.
So do I.
No sense worrying about it now.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Ray -- Something's here.
Where are you, Pete?
Third floor.  Get down here,
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
Boy, that was a rough one.
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
Agile bastard, isn't he?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
What?  What popped in there?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures, Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Mmmhmmm.
Me, too.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Do you believe in God?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
And the seas would boil ...
Yeah, Judgement Day.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
Don't you think you should at least wave?
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
Those are priceless sculptures.
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
If I may be so bold...
For the gods, spit it out!
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
You're coming back?
Where have you been?
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
What is that... wailing?
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
What are you talking about?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Yes?  Go on!
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
I want that bastard dead!
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
I am their hero!
Not yet, dear brother...
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Damn him!  I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that.
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
Then you'd be out of a job.
Gladly Caesar.
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar?
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
They won't break this one.
Where is my family?
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Caesar, ignore them.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
So am I.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Give away food?
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Take grain away from the army?
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Where is my father?
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
Yes, Caesar?
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
Yes, Caesar.
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
I'll nose around...
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
God of passages and changes?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
I've read of it.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The Senate too?
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
Why you?
My loyalties... were in doubt.
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Sneaking around with your brother?
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Why do you play at being drunk?
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
You cannot die.
Would that Marcus had lived.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He killed his father and then my family...
Where are they?
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
Servis made it through again?
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
So I understand.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
The Senators admire you.
They fear me.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
Tomorrow?
As soon as I can.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
What the hell was all that about?
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Serious stuff...
What deal?
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
My troops don't make policy.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
You brought the army into Rome.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
He's very realistic.
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
Greeks?
What about their philosophy lessons?
They're studying with Cynics.
You need to come home!
I can see that...
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
This is our oil from our estates?
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
Let him trust Quintus.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
Narcissus!
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
You teach them!
I killed too many barbarians.
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Death is a very light thing for you.
Take your hands off me animal!
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
You get to come alive again in the country!
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
How much money is involved?
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Then get a large cash advance.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Hello.
Yes.
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you always drive like this?
Do you want some dinner?
Aren't you eating?
No.
Why not?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
No -- why should I?
Will you take me home now?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.
But, Elaine --
Where is the car?
But could I just tell you this one thing?
What?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No, I couldn't.
But could you try?
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
What is the matter?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Benjamin --
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Do you?
Yes.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Was she married or something?
Yes.
With a family?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Did they ever find out?
No.
And it's all over now.
Yes.
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Okay.
You sure you really want to?
Yes.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
I do.
You do?
What's the matter?
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
What is it?
What?
That woman. The older woman.
You mean the one who --
Elaine --
No -- don't cry --
GET OUT!
Don't cry.
I'm meeting someone.
Where are you meeting this person?
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Is that him over there?
No.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
Here? In Berkeley?
Yes.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
But you're not enrolled.
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
-- really incredible --
Here he comes.
What?
I want to ask you a question.
Come in.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Because -- I am.
Is it because I'm here?
What do you think?
I said I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
What?
I don't understand --
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
What did she say?
Why?
Because it isn't true.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Then what?
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Please let me go.
Don't tell me --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
What are you looking for?
My belt.
Don't you have it on?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
The marble?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
What are you going to do now?
Are you going home?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
I don't understand.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
Benjamin?
What?
You won't?
I don't know.
But you might.
I might.
Is that so? You might marry me?
Yes.
When?
I don't know.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
I don't see how we can.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I'll think about it.
You really will?
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
I just don't think it would work.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Carl who?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Why do you have to see him?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
No, Benjamin.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Oh no. He said that.
Shhhh.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
No.
The day after tomorrow?
Benjamin?
657-2036
Hello -- who is this?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Is the doctor anywhere?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Thank you.
Ben!
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Yes, sir.
Exactly how do you mean?
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Yes, I will.
You a student?
What's that?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
You're not one of those agitators?
What?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- no sir.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
What did you do to her?
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
What for?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
I want you out of here.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I am going to call the police now.
Could I make one phone call first?
BENJAMIN?
Yes.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Mrs. Robinson?
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
I'm putting it on the top step.
I'm putting it here by the door.
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Hello.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Benjamin?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Where are you?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Where are you?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Did you get a room?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Give me an hour.
What?
Can I help you, sir!
What?
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
Yes sir?
A single. Just for myself, please.
Is anything wrong, sir?
What? No. Nothing.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is your luggage?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Oh no.
Sir?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
How are you, Benjamin?
Is there an ashtray in here?
Is it a girl?
Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
In general.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
What?
Will you take me home?
What?
You don't?
Thank you.
Will you come in, please?
What?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
What for?
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
But it's light in there now.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
All right then.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
Why not?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?
Drink?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Yes.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
What do you think of me?
What do you mean?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Did you know that?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
No.
Oh my God.
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What's wrong?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
What?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Like what?
What do you think?
Well I don't know.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
So?
Aren't you?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's all right.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Sit down.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Her portrait?
Yes.
No.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Benjamin?
Yes?
I think I'll go to bed.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I know that. But I'm --
What are you so scared of?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Then why do you keep running away?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
What if he did?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Why is it?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Would you like me to seduce you?
What?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
Where is it?
Don't be nervous.
Get away from that door.
I want to say something first.
Jesus Christ!
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Do you understand what I said?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Yes, I do.
Benjamin?
Yes.
Hello, Benjamin.
May I sit down?
How are you?
May I have a drink?
He didn't see me.
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Did you get us a room?
What?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I haven't. No.
Do you want to?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Do you want to get it now?
Now?
Yes.
Well -- I don't know.
Why don't you get it.
I got a single room.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- goodbye then --
Benjamin.
Yes?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
To tell you?
Yes.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
What?
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Thank you.
Yes?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Why don't you watch?
Will you bring me a hanger?
What?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
What?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Either one will be fine.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
You what?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Are you afraid of me?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Is this -- what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Are you kidding?
Wait a minute!
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
Wait a minute.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
If you want.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Are you tired of it?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Anything. Anything at all.
Oh my God.
Well?
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
How about art.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Oh.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Go ahead then.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Neither.
You're not interested in art?
No.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Can I take off my clothes now?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Do you really want me to?
Yes I do.
Do you want to hear it or not?
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What one.
What?
What novel did you read.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
There!
What?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Him?
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
There isn't any.
How do you get out of the house?
I walk out.
What do you say to him?
He's asleep.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
The driveway's on my side of the house.
What?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Thank you.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
We don't.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
No we don't.
Well how long has this been going on.
About five years.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
No.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
How many times a year.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Not exactly.
But you don't hate him.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I don't.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Is it?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
No.
What?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Why did you do that?
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Don't tell Elaine.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Are you shocked?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
What?
Not particularly.
Yes.
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Why are you asking me all this?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Art.
Kind of.
Well how did it happen?
How do you think.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
I'm curious.
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
What kind of car was it?
What?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
That's enough.
Don't talk about Elaine.
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
Why not?
I wish you'd tell me.
There's nothing to tell.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Do you understand that?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
No.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Let's drop it.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I wouldn't know.
Well, I'm not.
You're not.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
I see.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
What?
Don't start acting hurt.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Did I say that?
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
You wouldn't.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
If that's how you feel --
But it's not.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
You don't have to say that.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
May I stay then?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Thank you.
Then give me your word you won't.
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Drive down the block.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Now it seems to me --
Mrs. Robinson --
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
How?
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I don't believe you.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Go home now.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Where is Elaine?
What have you done to her?
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I'll find her.
I say I've got it.
Sir?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Very good, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Braddock -- Braddock?
Yes, but I'm afraid --
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Sure.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
What?
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
When I go off?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I drive around.
What else?
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Oh, no.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Why did you say that?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
Not if you don't want to.
I do.
But I don't want you to make up something.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
Goodnight, Benjamin.
You believe me, don't you?
No.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
I do.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
They don't know?
No -- they don't.
When did you two talk this over?
I'm just --
-- worried?
Well --
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
I don't know. I want it to be --
To be what?
Why?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Have you thought about graduate school?
No.
You got me.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
What?
I've got to go.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Thank you very much, sir.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Thank you.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Sir?
You'll never be young again.
I know.
Ben, can I say something to you?
What?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Quite a while.
Yes, sir.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Thank you.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
I'd like to hear it.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Oh no.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Oh yes.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
I will.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
I will.
Hello.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
Mr. Robinson?
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
No, it's not --
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Now look -- please --
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
I am not threatening you.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
But why?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
That's quite a statement.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
You miss the point.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Hello.
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you see me now?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
Dad -- can you listen --
Is anything wrong?
The Carlsons' are here.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
What's happening?
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I don't believe it.
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
I oughtn't to presume, but I --  I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
It's a short life and a gay one...
Have you a minute now?
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Time's getting short.
I want to speak --
Not now.
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
Well?
Yes.
And what are you going to do?
The pearls are in her room.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Need any help?
No.
No --
Why?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
I could take care of her.
How?
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
No -- no -- no -- no...
Why?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I don't like your tone.
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I've quit.
You can't.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
I'll pay you back.
How?
You might find a bullet through that head...
Like dancing?
Never?
You're a fool!
He must be very nice.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
That.
You?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Reducing?
No -- why? -- should I?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Very little.
Too bad.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Aren't you?
What?
Free --
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Where downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance --
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
We'll dance.
I'd given you up.
Chasing around.
You were very different yesterday.
That was lovely.
Will you do me a big favor?
Would you like to make a man happy?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Why?
I feel sorry for him.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Going?
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
You live here?
For tonight.
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
What do you want here?
Nothing -- only to be here.
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
Why do you look at me like that?
And then --?
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
And -- and --
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired...
So alone.
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Strange man...
Am I quite strange to you?
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
And...?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
Go away. Who are you --?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
Yes -- I do understand.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I want to be alone.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
I want to be alone --
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
Why do you smile?
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --
What can you see?
You are beautiful!
No.
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
What?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I want to be alone.
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
Really?
No?
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
And?
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
And what do you do -- now?
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
That's a silly joke.
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
There.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
I don't want them now.
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
And now?
Do you understand?
Grusinskaya --
Yes.
You do believe that I really love you?
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Shall I see you again?
Suzette will be back here any minute.
When are you leaving Berlin?
Very early in the morning.
For Vienna?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Why later?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
Bless you...
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
I can't.
No?
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Why do you think --
Why?
Don't.
On the train?
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Till then.
Thank you, sir.
Not at all, sir.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Then you know him?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Yes, quite.
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
The Baron is tired?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
What?
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
If we could scare up some men to play.
We could come to my room.
Ready, Kringelein?
Is that too much, Baron?
No -- not at all.
All right then.
That was my last.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
I take five hundred.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Goodnight, Kringelein.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
It's always so quiet here.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
The war.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
I must have made a mistake.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Be quiet.
Hello! Hello! --
Is that for me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
For me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
For me?
No -- letters to two-eighty.
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
And the child isn't coming?
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Good heavens. What for?
I don't know.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Any letters?
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
Anyone asked for me?
Any letters?
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
This gentleman can have my room.
Oh!
Send his bags up to my room.
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
The Grand Hotel.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night.
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Everything?
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Oh, I've got to find it.
Stay where you are.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Oh, don't go.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
No - absinthe.
You like music?
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
A man might what?
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Dance then?
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
I never danced before -- in public.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Really?
Please -- please!
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
What's the matter?
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Yes --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
You don't understand that do you?
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
What?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Later?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Oh yes, of course.
Do you like me better?
Am I!
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
I'm the stenographer.
Moreover --
Moreover...
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
No -- only occasional jobs.
Tired?
You pay me.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
Movies?
What is this?
You...
You...
Moreover...
What?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
What brown hands you have.
That's from skiing.
Skiing?
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
No.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Not too quickly.
What?
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
Cotton Company --
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
How nice -- your daughters?
My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Definitely off.
Miss Flaemm.
Hello!
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Tomorrow morning.
No -- now.
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
Well -- you want me?
Yes.
Well?
I must go to England -- at once.
Well?
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
I understand perfectly.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Of course -- of course.
A thousand marks --
Can you pay some attention to me?
Oh, yes.
Insolent young cub!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Baron!
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
I had to arrange about the trip.
Come here.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Why not?
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
Exactly.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
What?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
I mean with the Manchester people?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
All right.
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
I know you did -- I said you did --
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Sorry, Preysing.
You've decided against the merger?
Yes --
Then, it's all over?
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester.
What?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen.
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Shall I tell them again?
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You're a deep one.
I can't dance tonight --
Let us cancel the engagement.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
Madam has slept well?
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Madam should sleep.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Why not?
Take them back, Suzette.
Hurry, Suzette.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
I wish to be alone.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
It is time for the performance.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
There was -- there was.
Good morning, Pimenov.
He will be on the train.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Certainly, sir.
Again?
I don't know you.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
I could not think of not accepting.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
What is this insolence?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
You're discharged.
Me?
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
-- We must do something...
Yes, the police must be called.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Yes, I know them --
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Just one moment, sir.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
How is the house?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Have I kept you waiting?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No news yet?
No. No word.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Next week.
What's the matter with you?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
That.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on...
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
What you need is some relaxation.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
What do you want with her?
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Pretty as a picture.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Hi, Bobo.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
I want to keep my teeth.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Bobo, no, I --
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son --
Your what?
My son was in the hospital --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
Motherhood.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
You mean, the insurance frammis?
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Permanent damage.
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
You want a drink?
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
You know it, Lilly.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
Roy? He's always crying.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Right in front of the room.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
So here we are!
Want a look?
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Can't move.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
I certainly hope not.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
Not much time.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
What? He's going to be all right!
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
Why? What's wrong?
You are a valued customer, as you know.
But what's wrong?
What is?
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
But they must be! They cut glass!
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
All right.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
It's not your fault.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
Roy Dillon.
What's up?
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
When I said you being the best salesman here didn't say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say you're a top-flight man, but you've had no incentive. No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Just myself.
Sounds like a good Idea.
What? Me?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Well, uh... No.
No?
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Perk, remember?
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
So what's your story today?
They twisted my arm.
They knocked out my tooth!
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
Don't mention it.
I guess I owe you my life.
What happened to your hand?
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
I like those.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
Not as tough as you, huh?
Up to you.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Sure.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
Bluebell came in?
Lucky? You call that lucky?
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
I tripped over a chair.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
What's that?
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I pay my debts.
Expecting visitors?
You ought to put a bandage on that.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
Going somewhere?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I've really got to --
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
Myra followed you, huh?
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
You must have some money.
Just a few bucks.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
At what?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
What?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I know you do, so that's why --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
You want a drink?
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
Uh-huh.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
Never.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
For God's sake, Lilly!
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
That's right.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
I don't?
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
I don't see why not.
Well, uh...
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
A future. The only future I've got.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
There's nothing more to talk about.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
This time...
I didn't teach you that.
Let me see how you did that one.
Scram. Go home.
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Where's the five?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Roy?
Mm?
Look at me.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Her job.
I want to know everything about you.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
Mama!
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
That's just Lilly's way.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Get well soon.
Every day in every way.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
Big spender.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
I'll sign that affidavit.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
What?
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
Working the what?
The tap. What you do for a living.
I'm a salesman.
Myra, I'm not following this.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
The long end. Big con.
Nobody does that single-o.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I've heard the name.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Is that right?
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
And when he got serious?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
I thought these people were broke.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
Where?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just...
Take a hike, you mean?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Think about it. Okay?
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Yeah?
Open your door.
What?  What for?
You -- I don't know.
You were gone for a while.
I went out to Delmar.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
She didn't see you, in other words.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
And hello to you, too.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
What?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
I don't think I need it.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
Don't I get any say in this?
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
For Christ's sake, why not?
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
What is it? What's going on?
I'm happy the way I am.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
What's that?
You watch that mouth.
Roy Dillon?
Yes?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
I realize this is a shock.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
That's natural.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Gun?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
You up to it now?
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Yes, I know, I know.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
What?
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Ate the gun. Oh.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
Oh, Jesus.
No question, huh?
That's that, then.
Mr. Simms.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Why am I here?
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Well, when you put it that way.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Carter.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Where?
The cemetery...
Only the real stiffs.
I can be real stiff.
Care to join me?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Yes.
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
I'll be damned.
Mind if we sit down?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Detective...
Carter.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
A dead body?
It's Amy Kramer.
My god...
Do you know who did this?
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Another historical inaccuracy.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
No shit?!
Jimmy, what are you doing?
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
You sure?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
My office?
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
What the --
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Forget it.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
Where are you going?
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
You're twisted.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Nothing.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
It's an option.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Now you're joking, right?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Yes.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
He found you, didn't he?
Get on the bus.
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
What?  Where is she?
Oh, God... no... not Molly.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
You stole it?
Not me.
Why not?
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
What are you doing here?!
I came to see you.
I can see that.  Why?
Can I come in?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then I'll get caught.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
You really think Eddie killed her?
You look kind of cold.
I'm okay.
Better?
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
Looks great.  It does.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
It's John, isn't it?
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
This kid just wants his freedom.
It's not going to happen.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Hey, you alright?
What?
What are you looking at?
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
What?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
Who?
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
I can't believe this is happening.
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Yeah.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Keri, you all right?
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Look, they're staring right at us.
Wait.
What is it?
I have to pee.
Can't you hold it?
You aced it, didn't you?
Fuckin' A.
What's this?
Better her than me.
Ooooh, busted.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Shit, Linda!
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Thanks!
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Let the party begin.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Why?  You interested?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Mom -- Who is this?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Is Tim there?
Whatever happened to women in back?
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
What if your parents come home?
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Answer what?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
You've been watching too much TV.
He says things.  Bad things.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!
Mommy, I'm scared.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
Promise?
Mommy!!!
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
See what I'm talkin' about?
What is it this time?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
What should I do?
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
God ... this can't be true.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
My, God!  What have you done to him?
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
God, what's wrong with him?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
Halloween.
Where are you going?
Danny?!  Danny!
Where's the baby?!
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
What now?!
Come on!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
But surely Rogers isn't --
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
Where's the child?
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
This is madness, Wynn.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Jamie's baby ...
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Samhain.
You've created a monster.
No!!!
Stay away, Sam.
Yes?
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
What do you know about Michael?
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Who else knew I had the baby?!
No one.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Miss me, baby?
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
We've never met.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
Home, sweet home.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
You know what gets me?
No.
How all the magazines show tits today.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
I suppose.
Oh, shit.
At least we found the diamonds.
At least!
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
I didn't tell you everything.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
You know what gets me?
Go home!
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
The hell with the diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Can I have the Cadillac?
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
What'll you do for transportation?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
Go home!
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
Go home.
I'm liable to find anything!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
So long, Colonel.
Let's talk about it some other time.
How short the skirts are.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Months?
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Go home!
You ever own a motorcycle?
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
And how were things?
Otherwise, how are things?
Could have happened to anybody.
First Nagasaki--now this.
I dunno, boy.
The educational process.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
What's funny about that?
Excuse me.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
Huh.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
How do you know that?
You told me.
When?
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Really?
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Go to the funeral?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I didn't know we had any women left.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
I dunno.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
I dunno.
Hi, Penelope.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
What's this?
In what way, pray tell?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
You did?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Maybe it's time you got out.
Me?
Okay.  Okay.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I don't think so.  It could have been.
If what?
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Hello.
How are you, honeybunch?
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
Blue soup.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Insurance!
What an awful sound!
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
I've considered that.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Fifty years?
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
What?
We got to get another pilot.
For what?
For Africa.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
To make an ass of yourself.
What went wrong?
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
You're hollow, like a woman.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Out!  Out!
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Out!
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Anybody home?
As a matter of fact--
Sir?
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Hello.
Hello.
You were about to ask a question?
Are you--do you--
Ask it!
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
Is anybody besides you here now?
Where's Mom?
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
Man and boy.
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
She met him at college.
College!
College?
She has a master's degree in English literature.
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
He insults him all the time.
Excellent!
What's good about that?
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
England?
Oh hell.
Dad was never in England?
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
"The sting."
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
"The sting."
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Tell me that.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
Wow.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Mhravitch.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Uck.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
I don't know.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Go on.
Where did you get the poison?
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
Sir?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
You're supposed to get hurt!
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
They're not engaged.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Can't it keep till morning?
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Penelope!
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Will you go to bed?
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Damn.
Play?
A hundred dollars!
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
Dad--
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
What kind of exercise?
I'm a man.
No.
Dad?
Who was it?
Mom?
What's this?
Nothing.
No.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
No.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Dad--
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
I don't want to fight you.
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
I'm talking to you gently now.
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Can I help you, sir?
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Eighteen--  and a half.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Sir?
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
What time do you get off work, my child?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
I'm engaged.
You don't even know me.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
This is crazy.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Some kind of animal?
How do you do?
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Not at all.
What's the matter?
Give us time.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Disease?
Situation.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Bluh.
We thought a doctor might help.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We all are.
Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.
Harold!
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
Please--
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Say hello to your mother.
Now that's what I call fun.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
I did?
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
It's so--so stark.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Now--turn around, if you would.
Turn around?
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I have a brain.
I have some change!
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
Which one?
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
What a honeymoon.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
You're wrong.
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
People don't use that word any more.
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
No.
What then?
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
That's what you're supposed to say.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
It couldn't!
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Fish can't feel.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Such as?...
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
Go on.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
You learned this in some college course?
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
The doctor.
And what is his most cherished possession?
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
Yes.
And no one's there now?
I don't think so.
What are you going to do?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
No you're not!
I came for my clothes.
Sneaking in the back door.
Your clothes are at the city dump by now.  Perhaps you can get a map from the Department of Sanitation.
I came for Paul as well.
If he wants to go.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
A dozen?
Did you like it, dear?
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
Unless she has nerve.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
He knows you shattered his violin.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
He cried.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
Two hundred years old.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Things.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Just one favor.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Rifle?
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
Blue soup?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
Like what?
He's a child!
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
I plan to live one hundred years!
No you don't.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Honor, I suppose.
What a handsome word.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
No.
And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
I'm going to call the police.
This is suicide.  Go get the police.
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
I mean it!
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
You've killed women?
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
It's always locked.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
He's dead, you know.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Hello, Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Oh dear.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
We'll miss you so.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
And her fianc�!
And her fianc�!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
I've literally got to run!
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
I feel the same way.  What next?
None.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc� is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
You've been bitten by bats?
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
You have chills?
You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Would you say that again?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
I've never heard of it.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Are you've seen it work cures?
Wasn't that sweet of me?
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
We have, have we?
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
Good Lord.
I thought she was a widow.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
It died for your sins.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's a certain amount of information there.
This is man to man.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
What brought you back?
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
Yes.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
Correct.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You haven't heard me yet.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
Oooooo.  That hurt.
You're old--so old.
Now who's being cruel?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
You're a son of a bitch.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
Hands and knees, you say?
I'm high as a kite.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
I'm an honorable clown?
King Arthur.
You hope.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
Cut me open.  Find out.
I've struck my blow.
With spittle?
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
Poison.
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
I see.
Don Quixote.
My violin is avenged!
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
The new hero is you.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
You're too modest.
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
Here.  Finish the job.
I'm utterly satisfied.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
I'm going to shoot you now.
No!
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
What is this thing that kills me?
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Don't shoot.
No.  No.
No.
Can't do it.
Thank you--for my life.
It's trash now, like mine.
New lives begin!
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
What are you going to do?
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
Jesus--I dunno.  You know.  What the heck.  Who knows?
I dunno, boy.
You don't know?
It was a bitch.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Alice got married again.
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Dead!
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
For what?
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Who's dead?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
What happened?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
How horrible.
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
So long, you guys.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
I'm only ten years old.
Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
I heard you were looking for me.
Yes.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Premature ejaculation.
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
That is sad.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Ja?
I don't care what she wears.
Something's made you sore.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Kid--kid--
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
What's this?
Don't!
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
That goes double for me.
I don't want to live any more.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
Don't touch me.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
No.
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
I know.
Stay home tonight!
Oh, Paul--
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's a ghost!
He's alive!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
A what kind of doctor?
That's an interesting piece of news.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Not true.
Still lives with his mother.
How did she lose her feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I was afraid to ask.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
I didn't know that.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I don't really know.
I hate that thing.
Where will you be?
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
Yes, he is.
No.
Then who flushed the toilet?
Father's friend.
What's his name?
Don't know.
Mom?
That man is your father.
What?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
I don't get it.
That's why I'm crying.
What are his symptoms?
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
What does he say to do?
Really?
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Yeah.
Then get him.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
We don't have a maid any more.
Everything stays as it is!
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
My father!
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
Don't worry about it.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
It's fine!
I hate that thing.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
He is my father.
Please--
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
Doing what?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
He'd assume we had.
That's something I suppose.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I'm glad.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I know.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
Yes?
Something happens to my confidence.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
I'm touched.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
I see.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Coming.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
What then?
Did you see him?
Yeah.
Is he all right?
Far as I know.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
The park!
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
You figure!
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
A what?
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
How nice.
Did you talk to Paul?
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
What was it?
What's the matter now?
Possibly.
How long has this been going on?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
I'm sorry.
Marry me instead.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You're saying no.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
You were wonderful.
It's true.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
We made the date three months ago.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
What?
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
This is very good for us.
It is?
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
That's the XKE.
The what?
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
What kind of a life is that?
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
I wish Paul luck.
It's suicide!
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Meaning?
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
Why would you do that?
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
I'm amazed.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
They didn't murder me.
Paul's only twelve years old.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
We've got to rescue him.
He's not your son.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
That's been said before.
You know each other?
We met here earlier this evening.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
Get out of here.
You fool, you fool.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Do it!
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Is that a fact?
You've got to fight from time to time.
Not true.
Or get eaten alive.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
We simply stop doing that--dropping things on each other, eating each other alive.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
It's the planet that's in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
He died of a massive rupture.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
Kid--kid--
It's good.  Let him go.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Yes, we do.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
No.
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
No. I don't think so.
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
You mean I'm black?
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
The boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. We've interviewed everybody there.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
What are you doing?
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Big threat. TV would ream you.
No.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
Yeah.
Do you want to take a session?
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Well, I want to...
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No, I don't.
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
Pull out your cock.
What?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
Are you going to stiff me?
What do you mean?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
You want a tip?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
What do you mean?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
That's cool.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Wait?
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
How many weeks?
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Okay.
Hello. You want some information?
Yeah.
We offer...
Yeah, yeah...
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
I don't know no Tod.
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
That's all you got, three girls?
Man, how many girls do you need?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Is this all the display space we can get?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
What's that shade of blue called?
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Sam?
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Overpowering?
Yeah.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
Are you sure it's all right?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Are you the star of this picture?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Are you Niki?
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
No.
It's your money. You talk.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Yeah.
You making a feature?
Um-hm. Live sound.
Joanne?
You know her?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Do you know where she lives?
Nah.
Where is she?
Tod might know.
Where's he?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Are you a private detective?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Three hundred?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Up front?
Half now, half later.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
When do we start?
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
I thought you were going to bed?
No.
Huh?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
You don't drink?
No.
A friend.
Of Joanne's?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Jesus.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
And your wife? Where's she?
She's dead.
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
At least I'm a growing person.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
What rate?
You know what I'm talking about.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
Say what?
'Sucking off.'
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
You don't understand shit.
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
Is that the way it was with you?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
You used to work at Copper Penny?
No.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
No.
Neither am I.
But it's all you do.
How important do you think sex is?
Not very.
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
What do you care about?
What's T-J?
Tijuana.
They were here?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
He deals in pain.
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
Fuck.
I can stop if you want.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
More or less.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
Yeah.  Well, mostly.
I thought I was fucked up.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
It's not quite the same thing.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
Where does he live.
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
They are the same.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
But what?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
What makes you so sure?
Why do you say that?
She left you right?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Granville?
Did you find out where she was?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
What happened?
Where is he?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
But then you'll forget about me.
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
So then, Mr. Mast...
Andy.
...What do you have to offer?
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Who's paying you?
You are.
That's right.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Hello?
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mast?
Yeah.
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
In G.R.? Why?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
I've got a meeting...
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
That's like a stag film.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
No.
They're legal now.
They are?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Hmm.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I bought it at a store in L.A.
Who made it?
I don't know.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
What's it called?
But the police...
The police? They know less than you do.
Do you think she's safe?
Yeah. Probably.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
I'm only human, you know.
Get out.
But this is my apartment.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Yeah, sure.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Like what?
Where'd you hear that name?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
It's just a name.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
What happened, pilgrim?
Just leave me alone.
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
What is it, Jake?
What happened?
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
How's your business, Jake?
Pretty good.
Jake?
How did you find me?
Wes, do me a favor.
What?
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
What is going on?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
What plan?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Hey man.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
That's not true, Mr...?
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where does he hang out?
Where!
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No.
I want to meet Ratan.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
You're talking about real excitement?
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Who told you about this?
Rucker.
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Well...
Take it or leave it.
Okay.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
Where's Ratan?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
Fifty cents admission.
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
It's a short film.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
But I...
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
That's all right.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
What exactly do you have in mind?
In other words, you want to get laid?
Not exactly...
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
I thought you were a businessman.
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
Jake.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Sounds all right.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Hold it, mister.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I don't know.
You ever play Chicken?
What's that?
You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.
What does that do?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I'm worried about Jake.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
Maybe. Maybe not.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Who's that?
The guy who bought you that ring.
You can fuck off, too.
You're taking a big chance.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Jake'll take care of me.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
You working in San Diego now?
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
No.
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
You are at the University, Candy?
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Eh, Poli Sci?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Yes.
Oh, I don't have one.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
How long have you been driving?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Could I see your registration?
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Isn't this your vehicle?
No, no. I just took it.
Took it?
Your tree.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Okay, lady. Out.
Haven't we met before?
None of that, lady.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
But there is a family resemblance.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
We planted it.
Is this your shovel?
No.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Officer, I can explain.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Check.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Where are the papers?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Wait here.
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
And what do you do, my dear?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
How interesting.
Not very.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Edith was just telling me about her job.
I'm a file clerk.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
What do you want?
Sorry I'm late.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
A block of ice.
What do you see?
Here's your shovel.
Eh, no. Thank you.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Eh, no.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
I don't know.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Harold Chasen.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Do you dance?
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
Yes.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
But this is my car.
Your hearse?
Yearse!
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
It's very interesting.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
No.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Sort of.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
All right.
My door is always open.
All right.
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
Eh, fine.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Me! No. Of course not.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
No.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Yes. Very much.
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
It goes on and on.
What do you think?
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
Certainly a new experience for me.
You look as if you could.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
You don't look eighty.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
That's a nice teapot.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Why do you say that?
Because they are all the same.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
What happened?
Look.
What?
Over there by the courthouse.
What is it?
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
But what?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
But we can't just dig it up!
Why not?
But this is public property.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Oh, my. We're too late.
Is he all right?
What is that he's working on?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
It is kind of rough.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Look, the ice is melting.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Thank you.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
What's that?
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
What were you fighting for?
No.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
But I don't play anything.
Okay?
I think he's following us.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I don't know.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Yes.
I like Glaucus.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Well, I really don't smoke.
It's all right.  It's organic.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Did Confucius say that?
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
What was that?
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Of course.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
I like you, Maude.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
It's so blue.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Pray? No.  I communicate.
With God?
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
Well, why don't you?
No. I'd feel stupid.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
Where's that?
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Oh.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Maude, I must speak to you.
What is it, Harold?
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
But they have.
But they'll put me in jail.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Don't you advance on me.
Just like this.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
That wasn't very scary.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
How about some candy floss?
You sure have a way with people.
Yes. They're old friends.
Do you think there is any life up there?
I don't know. Perhaps.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
You should have been a poet.
- end where I began.
Maude.
Yes.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
I took them out.
Why?
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Supper for two.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Farewell?
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
But why now?
I feel giddy.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
It's true. I can't live without you.
"And this too shall pass away."
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
I have a sore throat.
Mother.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Mother.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
I'm getting married.
To whom?
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
What?
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
At a funeral.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
I don't care what people say.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
This is insane.
How do you do?
Would you like a cigarette?
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Oh, is this your father?
No. My uncle.
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
And why is that?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Just give me a rough estimate.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Fifteen.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Does that worry you?
Yes. It does.
Why?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Ah, yes.
And a lot of time.
No.
What about the draft?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
I don't know.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
Huh?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
None at all?
Well, maybe one.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
No.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
No.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
Your classmates?
Yes.
Your studies?
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Yes.
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
No.  I'd have liked to.
Why?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
What would you say?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Thank you, Uncle.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Yes, sir.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
Jeez! That's a great story,
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
You think so, sir?
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
To pit your own life against another.
That's right.
The moment of truth.
Another man's life in your sights.
Yes.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Oh sure.
Yes.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Eh?
How about to slit his throat?
Well, I don't...
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold!
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Harold!
Harold, calm down! This is...
Stay where you are, Harold .
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Yes.
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
It's different for us.
We've always been here.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
Julia.
Frank.
I knew you'd come.
You knew?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Yes!
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
He... he loved me.
Yes... Yes. You look...
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
It's a beautiful dress...
She's done it.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
I want to go back!
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
What's the matter with her?
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
God, that's terrible.
I... I had a visitor.
What?
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
No bad dreams.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
The box. I need the box.
What?
What do you mean?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Are you crazy?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
WHY?
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
What are you talking...
I'm scared.
Well... G'bye.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
Then why are you here?
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Wait!
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
I... remember.
Where am I?
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Steve...
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
What are you talking about? Who are you?
I thought Steve had talked to you?
He talked about Demons, huh?
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Who?
I need to touch it to "see"...
See what??
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
They were over here, Professor.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Story of my life.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Nah -- he's taken care of.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
That's all for you, Sammy.
hound of resurrection --
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
What is it?
You are a Catholic??
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
The freak in the gas mask --
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
It's almost over!!
Do you believe in hell?
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
What the hell was that? An ape?
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
I thought you liked being on TV.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Who wards off demons.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Reliquary --
Son. About Rasputin --
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
I worry about you.
Me?? C'mon --
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Don't look! Turn around.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
It's her choice --  She's human --
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
How does he know so much about me?
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
Who's the squirt?
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Got tired of me?
I don't want him.
Well, you did break out --
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
We're on the move.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
Sir, may I go first??
That voice --
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
She's dead.
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
I knew those men better than you did --
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
What are you trying to say?
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
Those things never work. Never.
Each of us gets a belt.
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
Don't move. We --
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
You call that thing a cigar??
Yup.
Thank you.
You're kidding --
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Whatcha looking at, John??
Helping you -- I just --
Myers??? How's your arm?
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Myers?
Yes?
What took you so long?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Hey. You: think twice --
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
What was that??
Where do you --
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Anything else you --
Are you sure about this?
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Alone?
You better have that looked at.
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Goodnight, then.
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
Out? Out out?
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
You're going alone?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
Hi.
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Red, I --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
I like that...
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Marco...
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
Doesn't sounds like him.
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
He's just pushy.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Cocky.
A brute.
I know.
It's freezing, isn't it?
But it's not true, is it?
What -- ?
That you feel that way about me.
Hit me.
Hello, I'm --
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just take it slowly.
Christ!
What's the problem?
You fucking ass-holes.
It's my lucky day.
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
What's happening?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
That your daughter?
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Oh.
Julia's my second wife.
Lucky man.
The box... you opened it. We came.
It's just a puzzle box.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Who are you?
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
This isn't for real.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
Let me alone, will you?
No time for argument.
Many times.
Nobody escapes us.
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
We want the man who did this --
We've got such sights to show you --
Please. Get back into bed.
I have to speak to my father.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
It's important.
Please listen to me --
You were holding onto it like grim death.
I don't remember.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Oh Christ.
Julia!
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
No.
You remember.
No.
Don't touch me. Or so help me --
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
This isn't happening.
One last time. Give me the box.
Come to Daddy.
This isn't happening.
Oh my God.
You bastard --
Poor baby.
Bastard.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Frank --
You're Julia, right?
That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.
There is going to BE a wedding?
Oh.  Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
Well?
I don't want to see the dress.
But you said --
What about Larry --
Wedded bliss?
I'm very happy.
Julia.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
Help me.
Tell me who you are.
No. God no.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What happened to you?
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Back from where?
...somebody...
What do you want me to do.
I'm hurting
Hurting.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Good.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Who?
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
You're hurting.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Later.
What?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
A long time.
This is what began it.
A box?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
What kind of doors?
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Hell...
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Who did?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You're still afraid.
You would be. They tore me apart.
So you were cheated.
And the blood let you out?
You can't love him.
I don't.
I said no.
She'll tell them everything...
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Don't you care?
There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
Kirsty.
Hi. I got soaked.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Which is where?
What happened?
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Sure.
Kirsty? It's very late.
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
I was here this afternoon.
I saw everything.
No, damn you --
It's ONE of these.
We're going to freeze to death.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Like who?
Just a thought --
It smells damp.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Not exactly modern.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
You're still blaming me.
No. I'm not.
All right.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Larry!
Where are you?
He's here?
How are you doing through there?
What have you done?
Is it deep?
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
You're NOT going to faint.
Shit.
I'm going to throw up.
Take it slowly.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Larry....
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Julia?
I'm here.
Are you all right?
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
I'll be down in a minute
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Who was it?
Is this upsetting you?
Are you all right?
Fine.
-- I'll go see.
Larry...
Don't go upstairs.
Huh?
Please...
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
Not much fun, is it?
What?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
What are you drinking?
Just soda.
Plain soda?
Please.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
That depends.
You know it's not often I... you know...
There's a first time for everything.
I suppose that's right.
You want something to drink?
Well, isn't it?
I... suppose so, yes.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Is this your place ?
Do you care ?
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
No personal details?
This isn't the bedroom.
What's going on?
I suppose not.
First time for everything.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
Why don't you do the same?
You know, you're very beautiful.
Am I?
Oh Christ.
What's wrong?
You're awake. Good girl.
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
You wouldn't believe me.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Who's there?
Kirsty?
I got through.
Where are you?
I found a room.
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
No Dad.
You'd like the house.
YOU'D like my room.
Well I want you to see the house.
Great.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
You will keep in touch.
Of course. Every day.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
Big house.
You like?
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Is Julia here?
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Surprise.
Kirsty.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Are you O.K.?
What are you drinking, love?
I've forgotten.
Never better. You sleep well.
Yeah.
I love you, honey.
Maybe you should give it some time.
I guess.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Really?
It's like she's waiting for something.
What?
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
Sure.
I have to talk to you.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Finished?
He's gone.
I don't believe it.
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
Get the fuck out of here.
What's the problem?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
No. It's all over.
Where are you going?
We're on the Cointreau.
I won't be able to stand.
You're not going?
Need any help?
I'm here.
I thought we'd lost you.
You know I do know the way home.
It's late.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
All right.  No. That's nice.
If there's a train.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
I see.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Oh no?
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
Oh!
Are you alright ?
I've been better.
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Are you busy after work ?
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Can I lend you a hand?
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
These THINGS... they want to take me --
What's wrong?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
What?
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
What did I say?
'Bye.
Do I know you?
Alison's.
Really.
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
You gotta be kidding me.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
I beg your pardon?
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
What's next?
Say it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
We'll do it next Monday.
Nice, Barry.
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Not the point.
Oh, so what's the point then?
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
What did he ever do to you?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
Yeah.
I wanna date a musician...
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
We can take your car.
What?
What do you mean, "what?"
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Ehh.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Why would they care?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
How do you know about that?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
Suck my ass.
Hey.
What the fuck is that?
My band.
What band?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
Isn't it?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
None.  Christ!
You're not even coming?
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
What's up?
Laura.  Her dad died.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Fuck off, Barry.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Haven't seen it.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
The little skate-fuckers.
No way.
What the fuck is that?
What?
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
So?  You even said they're good.
Like fuck you are.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
We're getting that anyway.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
No.  We need the gig.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Sonic Death Monkey.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
Why not?
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
I have all of the others.
They always seemed...
Well what about the new Echo --
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
I have a television.
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
What?
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
That's what I said.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
He's got one!
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!
We work there!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Who are you going to see?
Anna.
Anna Moss.
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Hey, Barry.
Oh, hi.
Where's Rob?
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
May I help you?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Uh.  That's me.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Right.  Why?
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Oh.  Okay.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Pardon me?
Your desert island top-five.
Is there a difference?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
What do you mean, four more?
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
Fine.  That's great.
Is that it?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Nice friend.
Yeah.
What's his name?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Yeah, sure...
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Hey Charlie.
Hey Rob.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Huh?
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
It's all kind of lost in the... in the dense mists of time now... It wasn't that I really liked Marco more.  In fact I thought you were more, shall we say, attractive than him.  It was just that he knew he was good-looking and you didn't, and that made a difference somehow.  You used to act as if I was weird for wanting to spend time with you, and that got kind of beat, if you know what I mean.  Your self-image started to rub off on me and I ended up thinking that I was strange.  And I knew that you were kind and thoughtful... you made me laugh, and I dug the way you got consumed by things you loved... and Marco seemed a bit more, I don't know, glamorous? More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
'Morning, Dick.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Good weekend?
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Great.
I'll tape it for you.
No, that's okay.  Really.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
What's this?
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Are you all right?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Fine.
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
I understand, Dick.
I always hated this song.
Let's not.
Rob.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Rob --!
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
Well we rang $900 today.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Can I do anything?
What is this.
It's Vince and Justin.
Laura?  Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
You look upset.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Can I help you?
What needs sorting out?
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Shit!
Hi.
Hi.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
-- Alright, alright but --
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
And do you like it that way?
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
I think you know that.
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
What?
Did you say something?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Yeah.  Great.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Fine.  One.
It sounds stupid.
Nevermind.
You won't like it.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Is what better?  Better than what?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Of course it is.
I don't know.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
Never?
I haven't felt like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Hi.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
We'll talk some other time.
So, how are you?
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I guess.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
Nothing.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
Will you call me?
I don't have your number.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
Hello.
It's me.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Are you still in love with me?
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
You don't ever think about other people?
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Is that the last of it?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
I'm sure.
You still together?  Going all right?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
That bad, eh?
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Ray.  I hate Ian.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
You know I'm a good person.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Don't forget your CDs.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
Hello.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Are you alright?
Pigsty.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Pig died.
Who the fuck's Pig?
I'm sorry.
No, no.  When are you going home?
Me?
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Look, are you coming or not?
Yes, of course.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
Mmnn.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
What do you mean?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
I don't want to go back.
What do you want to do?
When are you going back?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Hi.
You know, with Ray...
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Look, we can do other things.
Laura...
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
What about Ian?
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Mission accomplished.
Let's go home.  Okay?
Want to know what, exactly?
What it was like.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
What's the difference?
You know the difference.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
To make you feel better.
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
How?  How were we the same people?
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
No, but...
But what?
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
You're tougher.
More confident, maybe.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
I'm alright.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
You're being stupid.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Hi.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
Where?
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
Just local, of course.
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
I'm going to talk to you.
What are you going to talk to me about?
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I mean it.
I know.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Not in love, exactly, but...
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Would you marry me if I was?
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I don't know.
Very persuasive.
Are you persuadable?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Fair enough.
So?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
Rob here.
Hey.  It's Liz.
What's happenin'.
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
It's true!
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
It's a crematorium.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Is Ray going?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Enough, Liz.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
Don't you like that?
Hi, Marie.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
It's a great song.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
You share a place with T-Bone?
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
The Conformist.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Are you okay?
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I'm sure it isn't.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
So you'll stay?
Yeah.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
That way.  You?
That way.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
I'll call you.
Yeah?
Hi, Mom.
Everything all right?
So so.  Up and down.
She left.  She's gone.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
Hello?  Anybody there?
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
And after that?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
I knew this was going to happen.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
But you must have --
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Sixty.
Thirteen hundred.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Sure.  Ten cents.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Naw.  Those are for us.
I think you have more.
Well we don't.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
Records are those big round black things, right?
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
I'm Vince.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Nice.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
How old is Richard?
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
He'd want to know about all this.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
I warned you.
Doesn't have a head, does he?
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Claymore.
Huh?
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
You're the expert.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
You're very macabre.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Would you like more tea?
He was unsual.
Why?
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
No.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
I don't follow you.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
The boy _died_?
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Would you remember his name?
This is against the rules.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
-Okay okay.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Do you play?
Yes.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Byzantine?
Basil the II.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
Good reflexes.
Someone beat you.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Grave robbers?
Probably.
Who?
People like that rarely leave business cards.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
You have an active imagination.
I've been to Church Hill.
I have friends.
Jesus Christ.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Why not?
Tradition.
He tried to kill me last night.
Where?
Who is he?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
What will you do now?
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
He called you "MacLeod".
Not your concern.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
That bothers you?
He was innocent.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
What about me?
You?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
Have you gone to the police?
I'd rather hear yours.
You are being foolish.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
He sees me as a threat.
No one knows you're here?
You had to do _nothing_!
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
Is this what you killed them with?
You've been listening to rumors.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
You did kill those men.
Not all of them.
When you finish, what then?
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
You make it all sound so simple.
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
Yes.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
They do it each year.
Maybe it would do us both good.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
It's beautiful.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
Yes.
You're using your son's name.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
At least.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
A factor of age.
I hope I never get that old.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
Why are you here?
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I'm not even sure why.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Who are you?
That would be difficult to explain.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
Yes.
He knows about you.
He is older than I.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
That's insane.
Of bodies.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
What about that family in '31?
Sometimes innocents become involved.
There are differences.
You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.
Don't.
Come here, Brenna.
What is it like?  Being you?
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
What is it you want?
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
Will I see you again?
What's wrong?
What is it?
Get out.
No!
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
The inheritance.
Life.  It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
You have lived forever.
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Forget it.
I'm just curious.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
Now there's a new topic.
Thanks.
A murder.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What do you want from me?
I'm calling an attorney.
You and I should talk first.
Four?
All fashionably without heads.
Spare me the details.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
What are you getting at, Moran?
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
It'll never stick.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
You're an asshole, Moran.
I want Taupin.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
What were you doing in Felton?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
Good way to lose your job.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
Who is it?
I don't believe him.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
What are you doing man?
-Et lux perpetua-
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
Be quiet.
-Auditorium nostrum-
Stop.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Your name is Conor?
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
I was nearly killed.
I did at that.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
Aye.
I was driven out.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
How can you know this?
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
Pheasant.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
Why are you here?
You're a long way from Inverness.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
You know me home.  Me name.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
You are the same?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Yes.  Always.
Does it change with me in the room?
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
He told me there could be only one.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
I don't understand.
You are still so very young.
I'm twenty-two.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
What?
It is as you are.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
This is madness!
It is the truth.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
This can't be.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
You will live.  Survive.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
Why does he want to kill me?
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
Aye.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
But we cannot be killed.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
How can I stop such a man?
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Why?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Me arm hurts.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Go to hell.
Impotent cow.
It will take less effort as you learn.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
I feel hardly nothing.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
But why be so concerned about me?
And you?
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
I am not ready for this.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Of course.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
That is not me.
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
I'm your future husband, remember?
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
But I did live.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Some think not.
Who?
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
Oh please.  Another one.
What would you like?
Something pretty.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
David.
Who am I deceiving?
State of grace and all that.
Tradition.
Not so scared.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
No doubt.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Finish your prayers?
Finish yours?
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
We need more time.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
What is your position?
Second musketeer.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
You seem to understand a great deal.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
Equals?
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
We have no understanding.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
It can be different.  It must be.
We must talk.
Stay out of it.
Do not turn your back on me.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
You see Major?  You are not so different...
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Must he go?
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
Where did you learn that?
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Figure she's with him?
Yeah.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Should have seen him the first night.  Son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didn't even blink.
Are you sure?
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Where!
I don't know.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
How many came?
The last four.
And the Bulgarian?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
He knows I'm here.  How?
_Answer_ me.
Spare a chair?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
How are you?
Head still secure to the neck.
How did you find me?
And have you something to settle with me?
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
He found us even there.
I haven't drunk this much since-
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
You're insane.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
You're wrong.
Long time.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
Of sorts.
Run!
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
Leave her out of this.
This isn't done.  Get up.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Tradition.
It's all we have.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
Leave her alone.
We have some unfinished business.
Are you here?
And if I refuse?
Yes laddie, I have her.
This your present address?
Yes.
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Did you know the victim?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
It doesn't.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
What are you getting at?
What were _you_ looking for?
That's none of your business.
Do you know what this is?
I presume it's a sword.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Your murder weapon?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
A mystery.
My condolences.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Home.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
Do you?
All I need is time.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
You're a kind man to be sure.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
You're one of William's kids, huh?
His only kid.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
We were very close.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Morning Mr. North
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Nothing to be sorry about.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Are you back?
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
What doing?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Who is it?
What's the idea of locking this?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
How do you mean?
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
The poem?... The poem was great!
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
No. Roy. Roy V.
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Seventy-five.
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
Sort of a Jack London style?
I got my rhyming dictionary in --
I'll keep you in mind.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
Oh, it isn't like that.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
But --
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right, dear.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
The five hundred? Sure.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
But --
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
What's the matter?
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Did you finish the interview?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Hildy!
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
We'll explain the whole thing to them.
Oh, she was here.
Where'd she go?
Hildy! Where's mother?
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
Mr. Burns --
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Yes!
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.

Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Oh.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Where are we going?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
No -- she didn't.
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Mother? But your mother --
No. My mother.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just for the first year.
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
How's business, Bruce?
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
Anything the matter?
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
I'm beginning to realize that.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Well, she'll know some day.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Hildy!
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
The money? Why?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
You'll ask me to what?
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
No, you don't!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
What's this?
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Out of the mouths of babes.
Save that for the Tribune.
What do you want?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Hello, Hildy!
How long is what?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
I notice you still remember it.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
What?!!
I haven't any hard feelings.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
I have a lunch date. I just want --
You can break it, can't you?
Sure you can. Come on.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
What do you mean by that?
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You've had a better offer, eh?
You bet I've got a better offer.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Listen, Walter --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
What's the matter?
Sweeney.
Dead?
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
No!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Keep away --
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Get away, Svengali.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Please! Will you just --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I'm not working for any other paper!
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Bermuda.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
What's his line?
The insurance business?
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Thanks...
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Say, could I meet him?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You're not afraid, are you?
Afraid? I should say not!
Then what does he want with you?
Now you got me.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
What for?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Allow me.
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
What now?
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
You said it.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
What do you mean?
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
We're not interested.
Now you're talking!
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
What tricks would I pull?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Exclusive? That's great.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind that. What's the story?
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
Yes. Where is he?
Where do you think you're going?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
I know, but --
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald!
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
I'd like to think.
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
I get it!
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Hildy!
Huh!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
How much do you want on it?
All the words you've got.
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Hildy!
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Where's Bruce?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Railroad tickets.
Is he coming back here?
Double-crossing swine!
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
I'm finished.
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What did you do with her?
What happened?
Where is she? Tell me!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Look at me, Hildy --
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Hello -- hello...
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Is this the Community Hospital?
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Ring that number, will you?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Will you come here?
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Don't open that!
No, you don't! Walter!
No!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
Murder, uh?
When did you deliver this first?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Don't tell me you were worried!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
In a way.
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Flip a coin.
Well -- what is it?
Hildy!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Then why are you doing it?
Thanks.
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Where'd you wire him?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Walter!
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What's the matter with my brains?
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
What!
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
How about Bruce's?
Walter, you can't do that!
Hildy, darling!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
It'll be Heaven!
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Are you referring to me, Madam?
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
You grey-haired old Judas!
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
Anything you want, Boss.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Walter!
I'm busy, Duffy.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
What?
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
I think it is.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
There's money in it, Cooley.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
How much?
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Let's see the money.
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
You said it!
Me, too.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
I don't know --
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Well, that about covers everything.
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
I call. What you got?
Three bullets! Any good?
Who locked the door?
Open up there, will you!
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Boy, did you see her go?
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
So have we!
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Hold the phone!
I'll call.
Goodbye, Yonson.
What a chase!
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
We know what you're up to.
How's everything, Gus?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Little rum in yours, too?
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Gus, this --
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Just a minute, Johnson!
Take your paws off me!
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
What do I know about Williams?
Where'd you get this?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
What?
He's harmless.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
What went off?
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
After all I've done for you --
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
For who?
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Just one second --
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
Pete, you're through!
What do you mean -- through?
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Fred!
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Pure politics!
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
What is it?
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
I did.  Hold the wire.
No -- don't out me off.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
We'll fix that, too.
What?
Shoot to kill, I said.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
A sight for sore eyes!
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
That's a lie!!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
And so do I!
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
I won't.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Got you, Williams!
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Now, Hildy --
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
I can't.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Five hundred dollars.
You'll take fifty and like it!
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Where's the old lady?
We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
What did you do with her?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me!
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Who is it?
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
There goes another scrub lady.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
You fight it cut.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Okay.  Forget it.
Have you got my dough?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Come on with that money!
First you got to sign a receipt.
Where's the money?
Here!
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Huh?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
You know it is!
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Hiding him where?
Mother!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
Mother!
That man there!
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
What are your beliefs, Earl?
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Very simple, Earl.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
Don't forget about production for use.
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Don't talk too loud.
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
How'd you get here, Earl?
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
What good'll it do?
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.
They're not human!
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
What's that?
Quiet, Mollie!
They'll get him! They'll get him!
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Hey --
Are you all right, now?
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
What's from the Governor?
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
Get the Governor on the phone!
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
How much do you make a week?
Huh?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Who? Me?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
The what?
The City Sealer's office!
Why not?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
No, I don't think so.
For heaven's sake, why not?
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
But how do I know...?
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Pinkus.
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Is it hard?
Get out of here!
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
A very fine-looking women.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
Look out!
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Get the cops, somebody.
There she is!
What's your hurry?
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
What's he want?
The door was locked.
What's that?
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Can I try?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
That was a googly!
I know.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
Why?
This is going too far, young man.
But Grandpa, you said...
Give him the you-know-what.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Only till they get you into the local school.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
Pauline's mum got killed.
No, she didn't.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
I never was.
I know a secret.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
You want to join our gang?
I don't mind.
Do you know any swear words?
Yes.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Bugger off.
Sod.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bloody.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
You wouldn't.
Would.
You couldn't.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Tell them about Pauline's mum.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
It's easy. I've done it.
Who with?
Pauline.
I did see them. I did.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
...and four and five...
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Can't we just see the end?
They've got the real thing outside.
I'm starting my own collection.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Well, for the baby, really.
Crocodiles! Aah!
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
It's like telling fibs.
You said that last year, Dad.
What's that?
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Wow!
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Who pays for them?
It was great for me, how was it for you.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
They might be.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
Boy, that was some air-raid.
Air-raid?
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Where?
I don't know?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
And Jim.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
What about it?
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
You need trees for an avenue.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
Except the servicemen.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
So you're going to be a grandfather.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Here's to music. And absent friends.
And absent bridegrooms!
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
We all had to write a last letter home.
Has Sue got it right?
What's that?
You joined up.
Oh, that.
And what's that?
We don't know anything about it
Well?
It looks....foreign.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
That's it.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
What are you going to be then?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
You know it? It must be an old one.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
What would we do if a German came into the house?
Don't be silly, Dawn.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
The ideas you get in your head.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
And where do you think you're going?
Out.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
What is it, pet?
What did he say?
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
Is it peace in out time?
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
Up to six weeks, I think.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
It was the best time of his life.
I can't do it. What's the point?
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
It seems to have survived.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
We did the decent thing.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
You might still have a house.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
Father, that's enough now
What did I do to deserve this?
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
It's not fair on them. It's selfish to keep them with you.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
Molly!
You're having me on, Molly.
Am I? Maybe I am.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Really, that's a long time.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yikes.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
What?
Cone.
Huh... what cone?
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
I agree.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Tiny's home.
What about R.J.?
Ma, Tiny's in.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Who's your Daddy!
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
What about the tree?
Which way?
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
How much further?
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go?
He left!
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Thank you.
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
A dead one.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
That's not something to joke about.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
I'd like to see that.
Can I help you with something?
I was just wondering.
Wondering what?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
What?
You know... a couple of queers.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
What the hell are you laughing about?
He walks, duh.
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
You shouldn't a done that.
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Now, what makes you think that?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
What's this?
How long have you been running this place?
No, really.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
The Duke?
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
You mean John Wayne?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
I don't drive cross country.
I don't.
But suppose for a second you did.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
She's pretty cute.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Yeah, no shit.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Yeah.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
Perfect.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
How awesome?
Really fucking awesome.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Keep straight on this road here.
How much further?
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
It's a hitchhiker.
She looks like she stinks.
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
What was that?
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
I'll help ya.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
Thanks.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Almost there.
I like sleep.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
What's he so excited about?
Just grin and bear it.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Should we stop?
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Why are we stopping?
Go around him.
There's not enough room.
Hey, he moved.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.
Fine. I'll go straight.
Forget it. I'll just go.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Check this out.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Quiet.
I gotta open the gate.
Drive through it!
What I need are some answers.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Come on, get with the facts.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Is that all... think real hard.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
How's about you give me those same directions.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
Hmmmmm.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
That kid is one horny retard.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
What?
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Goddamn.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Fuck your grandmother.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
That's nice.
How long is that gonna take?
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Oh.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Huh?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Tickets for what?
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Fuck, it's freezing.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
So.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
So what?
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
When?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Thank you.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
What are you laughing at?
I don't know, I think he's funny.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Sleeping.
Rise and shine.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
I resign.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
Tell me about it.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
Don't even say it.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
How long has it been?
What was that?
What? I didn't hear anything.
I don't hear anything.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I still don't.
Jesus Christ.
A couple hours!
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
What'd we here, Georgie?
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
Yeah, no mercy here.
Not yet.
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
That's the understatement of the year.
God damn.
You find something, Georgie?
What'd ya got there?
Keys.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Huh?
Open up the trunk.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
Oh, right.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
Firefly.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
Huh?
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
This is way too fucked up for words.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
No, just a little too old.
Sorry.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Where's Bill?
Where is he?
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Well hello, officer.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Please, just a minute.
Thank you.
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
Grampa... watch the language.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
I don't know. I only saw one.
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
What should I do?
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy...
Who's your Daddy!
Get in... now!
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Hey.
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Fit the profile?
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
We gotta break it open.
Tell it to my daughter.
Jesus Christ.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Mr. Willis?
Yes, sir.
That's it?
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
I always favored the Hulk.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Aw, fuck.
Plates match.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
I guess not.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Wydell.
Over.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Harold! Tell the boy again.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
And?
Tell him, Harold.
Tell him, Harold.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
It's embarrassing, okay?
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Hello, my little boy.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Say my name.
Gabrielle.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
Like father, like son.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
French?
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Oui, doctor, oui.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Oui.
You decide. Today is your day.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Oui. Perfect!
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Not at all.
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Of course not.
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Coincidence, yes?  And how is our son?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
When you were a little French girl?
Oui.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Yes. Happy happy.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
I am sleepy.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
What is wrong, my darling?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Hmmmph.
Gabby, what is it?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Fine.
Not in front of the boy.
My little French.
What is it?
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
I love you so much, Gabrielle.
Unnhh.
Urgh.
Yeah? What?
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
I just want to talk.
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
Like what?
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
Well, I think...
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
Well?
God, you're beautiful.
Please. I look a mess.
No. You look so beautiful.
I've moved on.
No!
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
That's not how he tells it.
Hunh.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
You were wonderful!
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
I want our boy back.
Oui.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
We still have you and I.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
Please let me go with you.
My apologies, madam.
It's okay, Puff.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
Very well.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
You what?
I want to be the way I was before.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
He's dead.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
That's what I'm counting on.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Progress!
Ouch. Yeah?
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Always. Ow.
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
What do you mean?
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
My brother is discreet.
Won't he be able to tell?
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
So?
I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
My brother says he likes you, too.
Really?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
One night stand?
No. I married a midget.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Oh?
Be still my crotch.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Yeah. My brother told me.
And I think I'm going to.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Lila, it's Rosie.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Rose, please go away.
How'd you know where I was?
Nathan told my brother.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Oh, Rosie.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
I'm going to miss you.
Oh, Rosie.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
I'll be in touch.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
As do I.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
You've got to respect that.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Where?
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
You are a therapist, right?
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
How's it going?
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
Paper or cloth?
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
I'm not sure.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
We are animals after all.
It looks wonderful.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
My God! The fork! The fork!
I'm sorry?
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
Boy, this is good!
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
You do?
Yes, and...
You really enjoy my company?
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
You do?
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
What are you doing in there?
I'll be out in a minute.
I'm sorry about my parents.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Shaving cream?
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Yes, darling.
Oh, and the sun block?
Of course.
What SPF, sweetie?
Fifteen.
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Yes, darling.
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
Yes.
Flares?
Absolutely.
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
That's very funny.
Did you see that?
What?
I don't know. Something.
A deer?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Come on.
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
I think he's feral.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
He looks perfectly fine.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
What?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
All right.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who from work?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
You are an animal.
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
So, how's it going today?
Good. Making progress.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Of course not.
It would just be helpful to know.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
I'm just preoccupied.
Do you like my new look?
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Really?
Sure. Of course.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
That's great.
That's great. It's a great color for you.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
How's work?
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Have you?
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Really?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
How come?
Such as what womanly things?
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
I had sold my fucking soul.
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Should I come with?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
You were gone a long time.
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
So he's doing okay?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Shit.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Yes.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Oook. Oook.
Ooka.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
Oh boy!
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert tonight.
Yahoo!
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Extra dessert?
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Thanks to you, Nate.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Interesting.
Ugnh.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Unn.
Puff, put the gun down.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Unka unka unka unka unka.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
No, why?
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Wait!
Yes?
Mother?
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Yes.
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Boys just passing through?
Yep.
Pittsburgh?
Mm hmm.
Comin' in or goin' out?
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
You want a chaser?
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Check!
Give me a bottle of beer.
Huh?
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
No, I'm fine.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
I've never been to Louisville.
I'm ready.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
That's right, Miss Packard.
And a fact is a fact.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
I want to talk to you.
Do we need words?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
You know what's good for him?
To win.
For whom and for what?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
You bastard.
I'll make it up to you.
How?
Are you ready for another?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
That's the way it's done.
All I want's the money.
We'll be there.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
How much?
Oh, about five hundred.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Cash.
How much do I owe you?
Hey, mister.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
Okay?
Cut.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
I'm buyin'.
Thought you only drank milk.
Only when I work.
Yeah? Why?
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
I lost twenty bucks.
Pool.
You being cute?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Yeah. Sure, sure.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
I got drunk.
Maybe he knows how to drink.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
That's your problem.
A thousand.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Whaddya been so far?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
I told you. I got drunk.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
Thanks for the drink.
To do what?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Why?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Seventy-five per cent.
For who?
For me.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
You think I can lose?
I never saw you do anything else.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Hello, Eddie.
Hi. How's business?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Sign up.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
What happened to you anyway?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
I been thinking.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
How good is he?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Here, I got it.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
Hey, Findley's here.
Where?
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
So does Eddie.
What's the matter? What happened?
Well, we won't.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
Sure.
'Bout even.
I don't know.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I can beat him.
How're the hands?
They're fine.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
Please don't get off me now.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
I wanna walk.
It's a long walk.
I got time, Bert.
Tell her what?
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Half.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Well, here it's half.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
I'm a businessman, kid.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Fifty per cent?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Aaaahhhh!
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Maybe. You want to play?
Who's he?
What's your game? What do you shoot?
You name it, we shoot it.
Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
The expensive kind.
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Yeah, that's right.
He's my partner.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Why?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Whaddya mean?
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Well... well, now.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
It's quiet.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
How do you feel?
Fast and loose, man.
In the gut, I mean.
Quit. He's too good.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
How much we got?
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
No, it isn't, Charlie.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Get with what?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go to hell.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
Is this all we got left?
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
A son.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
I told you you'd get your money back.
With what?
Oh yeah? Where?
HOW MUCH?!
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Aw, Eddie.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
What for? To play Fats again?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Is that what you think?
Yeah, that's what I think.
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Just like that?
No, no more for me.
Findley.
Glad to meet you.
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
How much?
When?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
That's right. When?
Would you like to come out tonight?
What time?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
I thought we came here to play pool.
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Yeah, sure has.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Who's he?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
What's the limit?
Half and a dollar.
Gimme ten bucks.
Hi.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
You quittin' too?
You're a pretty good player.
How much are you ahead?
Couple of bucks.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Try me.
Shoot.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Okay, friend. You're on.
Call it.
You better not miss, friend.
Long wait for a bus?
How long you been waiting?
What?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
What time does the bus leave?
What bus?
Yours.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip.
Have a nice trip?
Fair.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Then why go to the bus station?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
Around.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
Do you always ask so many questions?
No, not always.
I used to be an actress.
Yeah? What do you do now?
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
You don't look like a college girl.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
So why go to college?
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
What do you do on the other days?
I drink.
Hey!
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
I could always get us a bottle.
No.
Fifth of scotch?
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
Why did you do that?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
What time is it?
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Why?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You told me.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Okay. So what's your name today?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Where you been all day?
At school. It's Thursday.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Thanks.
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
You want to go with me?
What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
Mm hmm.
You got it all in your head?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
What did all this stuff cost you?
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Eggs. How do you like them?
I've got something in my bag.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Haven't you opened it?
No, why should I? It's yours.
You going out?
What are you writing?
Give it to me.
What's this supposed to mean?
Give it back to me.
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
Who is it?
What happened?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
You wanna drink?
No. You?
A loser?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Would he know?
He knows. A lot.
Why did he tell you?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
He's a gambler.
Is he a winner?
Well, he owns things.
Is that what makes a winner?
Well, what else does?
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
I love you.
You glad?
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Well, what's so funny?
What is it, Eddie?
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
What do you want to tell me?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
For how long?
Oh, I don't know.
A week? A year?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
No, I want to walk.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Why should I?
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Fifty-seven.
Where's Bert?
He went off someplace.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Why?
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Well, what's the matter?
Go on back to the hotel.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Now and then. You know how it is.
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Is that a fact?
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Where do you come from?
California. Oakland.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
That's right.
I hear you've been looking for me.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Hundred dollars?
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Your shot.
You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
That's what the game's all about.
Very good shot.
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Game's over, Eddie.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
I came to play pool, Fats.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You name it.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes.  You got yourself a pool player.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
You lived like this once.
That is not now, human!
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Are you all right?
Yes.
How much do you remember?
Do you remember where you lived?
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
With them?
Yes.
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
Who is this?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Do you remember where it is?
What?
You want to find them.
Yes.
Why don't you start with me?
What choice did I have -- ?!
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
I only protect myself -- !
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
What do you want?
What do you mean?
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
We don't know that --
Mine.
Have you always had it?
I don't know.
Have you looked inside?
Yes.
Who?
That's who you are too, Emma.
You want me to stay?
Do you still want me to stay?
Emma...
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Shhh... don't talk.
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Yes.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
I surrender --
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Virginia...?
Need some gas?
Please.
Only got one kind.
Hell of a night.
So, what do you do?
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
You built things.
Bathroom?
Do we have to?
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
What's that, Dad?
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Is the hill ours too?
If we want it, it is.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
Why, Dad?
There are more this year than last.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
... and Rigel.
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
What did it look like?
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Are you all right, Dad?
I had an awful dream.
What, Jim, what?
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
It was so real, Dad.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
I was so scared.
I'll take you to school.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
Where's your car?
I left it at work.
I'm home now.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
What's wrong, Ellen?
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
What did he talk to you about?
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Is that all he said?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
May I ask why?
We were having a little talk.
About what?
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
No.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
Yes.
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
I'd believe him.
Why?
Do you know how to follow a map?
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
Where, Jimmy?
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
I don't see anything.
I swear it was here.
But it's not, Jimmy.
No.
They'll get us.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
Who are you calling?
Did you call the State Police?
No one comes here after dark.
What is it?
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
Don't go in.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
You're looking for life?
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
Your father asked you a question.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
What?
When?
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I have school.
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
What kind, Mom?
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
Oh?
What's his family background?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
Why, yes.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
What do you want?
You have to leave the White House.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
You're being paranoid.
What?
Connie, don't hang up.
David? How'd you get this number?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
What do you want me to do?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
Just my luck, no ice.
I take it you've heard.
You still believe in him.
Better be. You left me for him.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
Are you all right?
Did it work?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Spunky. He told you about that?
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
Love was never our problem.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
I don't know how you put up with him.
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
We're losing them.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
There's good news and bad news.
What's the bad news?
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Huh? Oh, good, good.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
Can you believe this?
What're you talking about?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
What happened?
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Not really...
That signal. It's a countdown.
A countdown to what?
Then what?
What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
I'm thinking.
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
Dad, don't start.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
Three years.
Pops!
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
You still got the Olds?
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
Can't this thing go any faster?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
They don't know this.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Dad...
What the hell is that?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
Not listed, huh?
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
Spunky?
College nickname.
You try Martin?
Perfect, she's using it.
It's perfect the line is busy?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
You punched the President in the face?
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
Dad, please...
I'm making a mess.
This I can see.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Pops, you're a genius!
What'd I say?
Thanks, Pops.
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
What the hell are you doing?
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Get us out of here!
What're you doing?
Nice meeting you.
We're loose!
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
I had a feeling you would.
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
But Mr. President...
Is my wife in the air?
Any news on my wife?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
And our forces?
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
How're we doing?
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
And our troops here?
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
But what, General?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
Where's it headed?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
That's impossible...
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
It had been deemed classified.
This is ridiculous.
With their shields down it might be possible.
A meteor?
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
He's trying to impress you.
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
Wait. I have to tell you something.
What?
Be careful.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Really? You don't mind?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
Yes, I am.
Dick-weed!
You're late.
You're late.
You know me...
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
You scared the hell out of me.
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Your son.
He's my angel.
Was his father stationed here?
So, what do you do for a living?
I'm a dancer.
Really? Ballet?
No. Exotic.
Oh. Sorry.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
I shouldn't have left her.
Damn it!
I didn't even see them fire!
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
Stevie... I can't...
Stop it.
It's all fuzzy.
I don't need it.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
But I gave you some this morning.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
You sure?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
How' he doing?
I'm not leaving.
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
But, Mr. President...
What the hell's going on?
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
Above American soil?
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Mr. President?
Call them back.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
Yes.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Can they be killed?
Why did you people come here?
Air... water... your "sun."
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Here... now.
And before here?
Many worlds...
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Peace? No peace.
What do you want us to do?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
My reputation precedes me.
Yes.
Yes.
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
May we go home now, please?
Marcus!  I did it!
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
All your life.
All my life!
Your treat.
What has the old fool got himself into now?
Dad?
Venice, Italy!
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Ah, Venice...
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
That doesn't look much like a library.
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Dad was onto something here!
How's the head?
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Yes. Now we know.
What about you?
Marcus!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
Henry, the pen --
What?
Look what you did!
The Word of God...
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Schneider?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
Are you expected?
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
That was our assessment as well.
Where did this come from?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
An old man's dream.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
You could be more right than you know.
Yes?
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
DONOVAN!
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
I'm through!
Yes?
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
I usually don't.
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
Bingo.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Are you sure?
What's that?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
Don't wander off.
I said go around!
You said go between them!
My room!
Mine, too.
The Grail Diary.
Uh-huh.
At least I let you tag along.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No?
No. You like the way I do things.
What do you know about this place?
What are you going to do?
This one. I think he's in here.
How did you get here?
You came back for the book? Why?
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
I never expected to see you again.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Dad!
Out!
It's important!
Then wait -- count to twenty.
No, Dad. You listen to me --
It is you Junior!
Don't call me that, please.
But what are you doing here?
Oh, it breaks the heart.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I'll never forgive myself --
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Dad, they come in through the doors.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Through the library?
Right.
Found it.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Well, what was left of him.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
...you did it.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
If only I could have been with you.
There were rats, Dad.
Rats?
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
They want my diary.
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
Well, uh...
You did!!
Look, can we discuss this later?
Will you take it easy!
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
I came here to save you.
No! Don't Shoot!
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
Umh?
How did you she was a Nazi?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
So did I.
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
What am I looking for?
My lucky charm.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
I ought to tell you something.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
What???
And the chair.
Dad!
What?
Dad!
What?
What?
Head for the fireplace!
This is intolerable!
Dad!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Stop!
What?
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Brody's this way.
My Diary's in Berlin.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
All right Dad -- tell me.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
What final challenge?
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Booby traps?
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
What about Marcus?
Marcus would agree with me.
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
What did you get?
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
I was the next man.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
We didn't talk. We never talked.
And do I detect a rebuke?
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Dad, how can you?
Well... I can't think of anything.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
What does that mean?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Dad, are we hit?!
Nice landing.
Those people are trying to kill us!
I know, Dad!
This is intolerable!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Dad?
You call this archaeology?
Dad?!
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
The penitent man is humble before God.
Penitent. Penitent...
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
What did you find, Dad?
What did you find, Junior?
I like Indiana.
Ready?
After you, Junior.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
Who are you?
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
That was seven hundred years ago.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Get that camel out of the way!
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I'm going after those horses.
I'll take the camels.
I don't need camels.
But, Indy --
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Where's my father?
Why are you trying to kill us?
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
Then we'll die.
This is your last chance.
All right! Where's my father
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
My name is Kazim.
And why were you trying to kill me?
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Just a routine inspection tour.
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Interested in local curios?
Charming.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
You think so?
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
Miss Scott panicked?
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
Who?
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
I sense the fumes of opium in all this. Perhaps Miss Scott picked up the habit in Shanghai.
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
There are no stories anymore.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
That was a misunderstanding.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
You understand what he tells us?
Dr. Jones.
Lao She.
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
You have insulted my son.
What's that?
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Step on it, Short Round!
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Indy?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
I ride with you, Indy?
Indy, look!
What you look at, Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
You don't like him do you?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
No.
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
What does it mean, Indy?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
Why they glow like that?
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
Come one, what's wrong?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Let up on the brake!
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
Two are still missing.
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
That's far enough!
Give me the stones!
No, the stones are mine!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
I don't understand. What's happened here?
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
What evil?
It is why Krishna brought you here.
Was the stone very smooth?  It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
I like the service here.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
Siam.
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
Are you crazy, a lift raft?! We're not sinking, we're crashing!
You all right?
What'd he say?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
What do you mean -- how?
The old man saw it in a dream.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Took what?
And then they took their children.
What'd he say now?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Indy! Help me!
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
A what...?
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
What?!
It's pulling me deeper!
Don't let it curl around you!
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
What?!
Can you move your arm?
Just one arm!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
PET IT??!!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
THE WHAT?!
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
What's happening?
It's starting to let go!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
What about the future?
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
What does the writing say?
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
He's afraid of something.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
Any more complaints?
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Not leftovers?
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Primitive sexual practices?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Don't catch cold.
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
What?!
WILLIE?!
There's bugs! Bugs all over! Help! Help me!
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
A fulcrum release lever!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
What is it...?
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I'm going down.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
It's okay. You're all right now.
What?
You've got to go to sleep now.
I want to go home...
Indy? Did you talk to them?
Yes.
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
No... they won't kill me.
What're we going to do?!
I can't!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
Anymore ideas...?
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
The last Sankara Stone.
And they don't even know what it really is.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
I get it!
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Figures...
Give me your hat...
What for?
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
I said something.
No, not her. Me.
My name is AL.
Where are you,...Al?
You're not gonna believe this...
Try me.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
Don't do that.
Arrrgh!
Who was it?
Me.
Who?
Al.
Yes?
You're in my head...
Yes.
Your name is Al...
Yes.
What is your name?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
I just got here.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
What street?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Why don't we go home?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Do me a favor, Al.
Yeah?
Somebody's been here.
Where are we now?
My place, can't you see?
No.
You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
Right.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Who are you?
Who am I?
Yeah...Who?
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
I told you, my name is Al.
You've heard of the PEM114...
Are you threatening me?
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
Me? What'd I do?
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
I don't know what you're talking about.
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
No.
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I just went there for a job.
I know...it sounds insane.
What are you doing?
Loading a gun.
What for?
Kill myself.
Are you crazy?
Yep.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
You're not crazy.
Hear voices don't I.
Of course you do!
You're gonna explain.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Yeah.
Why he's argumentative?
You'll be alive.
With a man in my head...
What was that?
You weren't listening!
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
No they won't.
Why not?
I'll talk to them.
Oh...Gooood!
I'll tell you what to say.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Anyone there?
Behind us?
What'd he look like?
What do I do?
Outrun them.
Now what?
I wouldn't say that.
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
I want out.
Too late...They want you.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
Calm Down! Act rational.
I don't know...To get Al.
Did you hear that?
It can't take that long.
JOE Or what?
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
Yeah...Who is?
I am. You are.
You are CRAZY!
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Find You?
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Sue them.
I don't like the sound of that.
We have to get out of here.
Door's locked.
Now what.
Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?
Which way do I go?
What does it say.
Corridor A.
Take a left and your next right.
A lab and equipment.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Who did?
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
Like the guys that attacked us.
What do you mean?
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
That's not a good idea.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Gone where?
You need ID in there?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
I'm back.
I'm at the airport.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
What am I supposed to do?
What is it?
What do we do?
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
You mean...just leave.
We get on a plane.
What about money?
What about it?
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Who cares?
I'll get in trouble.
...and a license to kill...
It's just not enough.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
Oh yeah, to what?
You'll be me.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
Now what?
The beach.
The beach?
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
Holy shit!
What is it?
Do you notice anything.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
Swim.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
You eat it.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Now what?
The sand.
Eat it?
I don't want to eat it.
Why not?
It's sand.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
Al, are you doing anything in there?
What? What do you mean?
Beautiful!
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
She's...pretty fast.
What is it?
You're beautiful..
What's happening?
She doesn't seem to understand.
Try another language.
Which language?
Help me out, will you?
What?
.
Where is she staying?
Touch her.
What?
...Joe.
Where are you going?
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
It worked.
I made it work.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Rene...
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Well you did it today.
Yeah. I did it.
Now, where would I be?
But what's it look like?
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
What is it?
You really like that shirt?
Much too blue.
Mind your own business.
It is my business. It's my name.
Not that tie with that coat.
What did that cost?
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Which one is she?
They both look good to me.
Get close to them.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
What glasses.
Follow that busboy.
I feel like an idiot.
Which one?
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
Just don't show fear.
I don't know what's going on.
He recognises you, throw him off.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Joe, be careful!
They're all in it.
How do you know?
Voice stress analyzer.
Even Rene?
She's the toughest to read.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
What is it, your charm?
This just won't work.
You're doing great with her.
Not her. You!
What is it?
It's embarrassing.
What if she says something important?
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
You got any books in there?
Oh come on.
You shut down your sensors.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
What Happened?
I don't know!
Is that all?
She's got the most beautiful...s
And on my time.
It's not your time. I get time off.
You been had. We have.
Some agent you are.
Bingo.
You found her.
Better. I found Ryuji.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka.
Osaka?
Don't you think I stand out like this.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
What do I do?
Follow her.
On what?
Come on, she's getting away.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
Sapporo..
Just stay here and rest.
Where are you going?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What do I do?
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
I told you, I have a feeling...
One of your instincts?
Don't touch a thing.
...drink it.
What next!
I can't...
You have to! Quickly!
Ow!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I can't see a thing.
What?
Never mind, just say it.
He was with Gruner!
I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
I don't trust her.
It's him.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
I've got an idea.
Not sure at all.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
What was it? What'd I say?
haka xuki.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
Left...The one with the red dot.
Well...?
He hung us up dry.
While he makes the run.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
And Dieter?
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Do it.
I can't handle that thing.
Are you alright?
Aim just in front of his face.
Holy...
He aready made the deal..
The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
Dieter!
There's a lot you don't know.
This may hurt.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Do something.
What exactly?
What happened?
Be quiet.
Where've you been?
Never mind that, where are we now.
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
I can always flush you down the toilet.
Keep thinking.
I have been... I think you're right.
About what?
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
Rene?
Now, you're too suspicious.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She is beautiful.
Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
You're a lucky man.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
Awwww...
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
I'll get us out of here.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
What are you doing?
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
JOE What abilities...?
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
Not that truth!
It'll remind me of you.
Doesn't matter.
What part what?
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.
What is your name?
No!
Oh, I can't.
I'm against it.
Can you fly this?
I'm...scared.
I didn't do anything.
Nice?
What kind of a deal?
Let us get to the border!
I knew you were trouble.
What happened?
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
In him?
It's a long story.
They have stolen state property.
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
Rene?
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
Me.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
You've cut your hair?
PEM115!
**?!!
How about a deal?
Surveillance Cameras?
They took the tapes.
You have nothing...
We'll have to let them go.
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
He work for us?
What Job?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Sir?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Bit expensive, sir.
We met on the beach.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
I have a new client.
That crazy guy?
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
It's just money.
Yes?
He's not an ordinary man.
Al Viola.
It is to me too.
...Foreign service.
What brings you here?
And...you know Jan Gruner?
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
What?
Your memory.
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Oh.
You may not remember things.
What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Remember what?
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Right.
Who...are you?
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
How do I look?
Fine. You look fine.
Thanks.
Well...
Well what?
We're here.
Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Oh.
Oh....Sure.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
Joe.
What?
Take the card.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Not you. Them.
Who?
Al?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Ahhh...nothing.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Not...complaining, actually.
Sue who?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
I noticed you staring.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Don't do it!
Just give me the keys.
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Now you know what I know.
Yes...What is it?
What do you want?
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What?
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Then who did?
Oh...and who is it!?
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
No. No one to speak of.
...Blake
Blake?
The poet...something he said...
Blake said that?
I'll be right there.
Where?
Dinner...tonight.
And you.
...right here too.
I can't do that?
Do what?
Let you leave without it.
What's so funny?
What way?
Wait. What's your name?
You mean from it.
And you?
You again.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
Why?
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
It's not apparent.
...and sort of...disinterest.
I am sort of scattered.
You are.
Promise you what?
That you're not crazy.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
You talk to yourself.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why do you do it?
If I was with you, I wouldn't
You did.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
You're talking to me.
And how'm I doing?
You're doing...Okay.
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...Naw. Made that up.
Who do you work for?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Trans Ocean Travel.
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Hires you for what?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
How often they come here?
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
And you, what do you like?
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you leave?
They left. I had to go with them.
Why did you stay with me?
Wanted to get to know you.
Why?
Who else is interested in me?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Were you working for him last night?
Last night?
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
No, he didn't do that.
No.
Who did?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
You're leaving.
I'm leaving too.
Why?
This business is over.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
I'm just on vacation.
You know where he went?
What's he done?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
He must be a good friend.
We're very close.
A chip. Goes in a computer.
One chip?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
How do you know you can trust me?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
What is it?
Hiroshima.
You don't believe me.
Oh sure.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
Who was?
Ryuji and Gruner.
And Dieter.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
And you?
Where we going?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
What?
Now what?
We figure out if it's in here.
How?
That must be him. Water taxi.
Get us one.
Where what?
If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from?
Hong Kong.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
I asked him.
Why'd you ask him.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
What?
Chiang Cho?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
You've  been there?
I know the territory.
So do I.
This going to work?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
Why not?
Can you?
What happened?
I can't fly it.
Are you alright?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
Looks like they can. What did they do?
They asked about you.
What did you tell them?
That I really don't know.
Now what?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
What a mess.
You can say that again. What do we do?
What?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
How?
Now what?
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
Don't worry.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Just like that?
I'll come back for you.
Kiss her you fool.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I knew it. I told him.
Now what?
He can't help us.
Do something!
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
You are, I've seen you.
It wasn't me. It was him.
It was you.
He told me what to do.
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
Come on.
That's twenty feet high.
Riuji?
What is it?
He wants to apologise.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
What could you find in this place?
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Why'd you invite me here?
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
What about the others.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Is there anything else?
A drink...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Wait.
Why?
You can't take that.
Why not?
It is?
It will be fine. You have another.
Just one. The back up.
Could I have it, please.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Tear it apart?
Yes.
Mom...what are you doing here?
Right there.
This the only spare?
Yes.
The other working.
Ow?...
It'l be alright.
It will.
It doesn't hurt.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
What does he know?
Look, nobody knows we did it.
It'l take months.
So we better get started.
Hi, honey.
What's new?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Yeah? What for?
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
I'll take some.
Instant rice...?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
What's that outside, Daddy?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
I heard them.
Where?
He's into kind of little cars, that...
That remote control thing?
Yeah.
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
Yes, baby?
Let me tell you something, Lowell. Look, look, look. You're talking about two agents in a regional office in Louisville. I got the goddamn Unabomber threatening to blow up LAX! I gotta move 45 agents from all over the country into L.A.  Alright? When I get a chance, I'll give it a look...
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
How long?
Three hours.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Sure. Where?
P.J.'s.
When's your deadline?
Monday.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Are you all right?
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
What does that do?
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Shit...
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Alright, alright.
When's the air date?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
What was that about?
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Good.
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
Do you want more rice?
Maybe later.
What are you cooking?
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
"Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio.
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
Yeah, I heard rumors.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
So, what are you going to do?
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
What the hell are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
I'm not touching my film...
No, I'm not...
And what are you implying?
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
A gun? Yes.
What caliber is your gun?
What caliber is my gun?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
That computer has everything...
Debbie...
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
What about you, you got a crew already?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Okay.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
No, no, we're fine...
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
Mike... Mike... Mike...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?"
Come again?
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Hey, Lowell.
How are you, Jim?
Hi, baby.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Hello?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Okay.  Lowell?
Yeah?
You're sure you want to do this?
Why?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
You ready...?
Lowell?
I can take her.
Don't you have to be at the office?
Is there any more rice...?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Uh, what are those boxes?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
What do you need at the store?
Soy sauce...
Right now?
That's my stuff from the office...
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...
I don't understand.
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Why? Who said?
Thomas Sandefur...
What's going on?
I'm doing an interview.
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
What's the difference...
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Thank you, Bob.
Who's calling?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Did you say Berman?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
"60 Minutes"?
Yeah.
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
No classes this morning?
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
What's wrong?
They're killing the Wigand interview...
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
What are you and Mike going to do?
I'm alone on this...
Jeffrey Wigand...
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
I got perspective.
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Yeah...
...you fucked me!
Is it too late?
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Alright.
Area code 212-555-0199.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
That's right...
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
It would be better if he called us.
Yeah.
Alright?
Yeah, I'm here.
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
We're there.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
You eating with us?
Yeah.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
No shit.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
What do you mean?
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
So, is everything okay?
Thank you for saying that...
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Oh, man.
Who are these people?
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
Lowell.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
Lowell.
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
Lowell!
What?
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
Yeah.
I disappeared on you?
Alright. What did you think?
Did I get you up?
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Yeah, that's right.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Oh, please, Mike...
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Mike... in my...
That Canada story? Still interest you?
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
Coffee?
Yeah... Thank you.
How have you liked your stay?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and I see the questions first. Then I decide if I grant the interview.
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
Who's that?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
I know what I have to know.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
...but that's as far as I go...
Far as you go where?
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Did work.
How much would I get paid?
Should I just take the documents now?
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
What do...
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
Why am I gonna mention your name?
How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Like what?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
Seven dwarfs?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
The new place? New.
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
...okay.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Hello. You there
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
What did you get us?
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
Next to your father?
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
Why?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
No.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
You believe that?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Yes.
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
I don't think you really understand --
No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
Excuse me. Yeah...
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
They do this with impunity!
Jeff...
Good. But Jeff...
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
Lowell, I can't afford --
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
I heard.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
You attract a crowd.
Yeah, great.
I heard about the Kentucky gag order...
What's changed?
You mean... since this morning?
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
What?!
No.
No? No, what?
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
She sued you for back payments of child support?
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
What?
Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company?
ABC...?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
That's not the point.
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
You manipulated me into this...!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You greased the rails!
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Where are you, anyway?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You try and have a good time.
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
Did he hear you?
What about now?
What?
What's happening?!
He doesn't seem to be listening...
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
I can't say that!
Just give me an example...
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
Well, what do you really think, though?
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
What are you talking about?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
There is -- there is no family.
What do you mean there is no family?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Where you staying now?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Right.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
You're gonna get your fix...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Most certainly.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Poor communication skills.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
"I would bet on it."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object to the form of the question!
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
It acts as a...
Object!
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Hello.
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Jail?
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Seven...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Chapter and verse.
Is that a threat?
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
You threatening my family, now, too?
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
That's why we hire scientists...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Well, I wouldn't say --
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
He --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
They hate each other --
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
You did good, Massey!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
So she's uh, flourishing?
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
What a touching story.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
What part?
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Who's the pigeon?
Who do you want me to kill?
Is that... one person?
You're in a rush.
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
That's his lawyer.
Triple!
You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Objection, your honor!
Grounds?
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
We rest, Your Honor.
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
I don't need it.
You want Botox?
What the hell is Botox?
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
Why in God's name would I want...?
No frown lines.  New watch?
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
It was a gift from a client.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
We did not.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
You're in check.
Got any symptoms?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
What?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
What?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
He's the wrong man.
I'm happy for you, pal.
Thanks, buddy.
Is she Asian?
Asian? No.
I have it.
You have the pre-nup?
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
It's your move, Miles.
My God.
What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Yes?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
What do you mean, was.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Marylin! What have I done?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
What is your husband's profession?
So who'd you hire?
You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
No.
You like kids.
Why do you think she did it?
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
I begged you to have a baby!
You're vulnerable.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
Is Tong older than Ming?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Oh boy. If he only knew.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
How nice.
These are yours.
I assume this is on Rex?
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Did you see the tape?
Not yet.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
What does your lawyer think?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
But you don't agree?
How do you know?
Why would you be here?
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
No.
You don't believe in it.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
You just haven't met the right person.
He wants a reconciliation.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Gotcha.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
He'll regret this.
Oh, for the love of...
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Getting married.
To him? He's a sick freak.
He's passionate.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
But why him?
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
So I hear. Is that all?
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
Have you tried the duck?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
To victory.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
Hello?
Miles?
Yes? Marylin?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Marylin? When did I say...?
Screw you, asswipe!
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
No. Don't stop.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
From a -- girlfriend.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Is that you?
Me. Yes.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
Hmmm...
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She never particularly cared for me.
She didn't love you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She held that against you?
Apparently she was very disappointed.
And here I thought my mother was...
Your mother was.
We're damaged goods.
No, we're not!
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
No.
Friends?
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
What is it Miles?
I want to be your -- your wife.
Huh?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Did you just propose to me?
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Yes.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
No.
Do you want to sleep on it?
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
I don't have a ring!
I know.
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Oh Miles!
But?
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Honey, I could sit...
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Good.  Are those foods?
Fabric and fringe.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Miles.
Hi.
I have a surprise for you.
You don't like me?
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
Miles? You're scaring me.
May I come in?
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
I don't believe you have "things."
Comfy!
What do you want?
I want to nail you ass.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
STUFF.  Got a light?
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
Those are gifts.
You can't prove anything.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Meaning my house.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
That's blackmail.
Hello?
Marylin?
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
You have to leave the house immediately!
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
No buts. Now. Out.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
I fell in love Miles.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
It's a no go, Joe.
Marylin!
Wait! He works for YOU?
Now. But first, he worked for you.
You were going to have this thug...?
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Hello Marylin.
Hello Miles.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
It's not something I wanted either.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Forgery? Fraud?
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Murder!
Pre-Castro.
Sweet.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We are. And it's winding down.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Marylin?
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Hello, Rex.
Marylin.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
I'm sorry. Where were we?
I was devastated. Of course.
Who's that?
Is this a lover?
Forgery and Fraud?
You used his credit card.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
She did a Harriman.
Miles Massey.
Of Massey Myerson?
Do you know him?
Who's she?
Maybe.
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Lilly's up.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Shit.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
You're not...
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Is this Ming?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
What?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
But you're going through with it?
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
So what?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Well, that's about to change big time.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Wait. I know you.
Yes?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Excuse me?
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Herb wants to see me?
Mr. Massey --
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
What?!
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client has ruled that out.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
That's delusional.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Ha Ha.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
...arty farty!
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Did Marylin end up with money?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
And it's good!
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Where does that leave us?
Rex, please.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Thank you.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Mm.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Ah.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
I'm not sure.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Video.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Nothing.
And she has...?
Video.
Wrigley!
Sorry.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
No. You're not.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
What do you think?
What are they?
Berry spoons.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
HA!
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
What...?
She owes me a meal.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Wrigley?
Miles.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Hi, Sweetie.
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Three is not Farrow.
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Oh�Mary�
Yes, sir?
How is she?
Why�uh�she's all right, sir.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Oh, no, sir. No different than�
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me�those things give me a stiff pain.
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if�
Mr. Warne?
Yeah.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami�  for the love of it?
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in�
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
And this is what you want�thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Yes, I know�but�
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
What ten thousand?
The reward.
Who said anything about a reward!
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for�
You're a peculiar chap.
We'll go into that some other time.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to�
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself�long ago.
Do you love her?
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
What's this about not eating?
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Why don't you put me in chains?
I might.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
You ought to know why. Because�
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because�
Because marrying that fool King Westley is�
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
Where are you taking me?
South America.
South America!
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
I'll get it annulled.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it�if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm�mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
You talk as if he were a gigolo�or something.
Never mind�I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Ellie�
Oh, hello, Dad.
I knocked several times.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Stunt?
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, yes. I heard.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
Nothing.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm�I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions�I�  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Oh, no.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare�I�when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
On the road.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
No.
Who is he?
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
Well, if it's as serious as all that�we'll move heaven and earth to�
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
Oh, come now�
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Well!
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
He's marvelous!
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
I don't know.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Is that his name?
Peter Warne!
Why? Do you know him?
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
I'm sorry you read it.
Are you going to see him?
I suppose so.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I�
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
She hasn't had a thing yesterday�or today.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one�
It's my daughter! Go after her.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
What about that diamond wrist watch she had on�she can raise some money on that?
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
You've made that quite evident�with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
Why; naturally, I�
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
You talk as if�
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
What would you like to have me do?
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me�and maybe we'll be friends�  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that�
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye.
We've done that already.
What happened?
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Any others?
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
They're practically all the same, sir.
Amateurs!
Don't want to talk to�don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it.
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
What happened to your money?
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York�and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn� As life's corners I . . .
All right, let it go.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
Whadda you want!
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller.
What do you think you're doing!
Huh?
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do�kid me?
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Oh, yeah?
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Oh, yeah?
Driver!
Yeah?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
I beg your pardon!
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you�  scram.
Tell that man not to drive so fast.
Are you talking to me?
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
What am I going to do now?
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
No. I'd rather you didn't.
I don't want it reported!
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Yes.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is�  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
My ticket?
I found it on the seat.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews.
What are you talking about?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Take my advice�grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
I didn't ask for your advice.
That's right. You didn't.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
What for?
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it.
I never thought of that.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
Here, boy!
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Of course I do. What do you mean�
Beat it!
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
That's none of your business.
Now, just a minute�you can't�
Hey, Brat�!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Your ego is colossal.
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but� you've been very kind.
That, I suppose, makes everything�uh�quite all right.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
You're not really serious about this, are you?
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first�then the tie�then the shirt�now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I�
Do you mind putting out the light?
Who are you?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Here�
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You�you had it pressed.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
You'll find the showers�and things�right back of the second cottage.
Outside!
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
I can't go out like this.
Like what?
Like this. I have no robe.
Where'd you say the showers�and things�were?
Hey�you're little, aren't you?
Where is the shower?
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
High time you got back.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Hurry up and get dressed.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Egg. One egg�doughnuts�black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Nope. No complaints.
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I thought maybe�uh�"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Yeah?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I�I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Santa Claus?
King�King Westley was in it.
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Thanks, professor.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you�
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
You weren't so bad yourself.
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough�we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
How about Cinderella�or a real hot love story?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
You always want to run everything.
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
I better go over and see her.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman�a trip like this.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
What's the matter?
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Not as long as I'm alive.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
What do you mean�starvation?
It takes money to buy food.
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
To New York?
I'm following you.
Aren't you afraid of me?
No.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
This isn't "piggy-back."
Of course it is.
You're crazy.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride�
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Yes.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
My uncle�Mother's brother�had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
That's silly.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation�a warm heart�and a loving nature.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
Not a one.
You're prejudiced.
This looks like the best spot.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
Peter�
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Well, take them off.
What!
What's the matter?
Oh, Peter�
What's got into you?
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
know�but�
Here. Eat your head off.
I don't want it now.
Thought you were hungry!
was�but�
But what!
was so scared�that it scared�
What?
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
What are you thinking about?
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Really?
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Hitch-hiking.
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
No. But I've got a penknife.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Carrots.
Raw?
Uh-huh. Want one?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.
What if nobody stops for us?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
You're an expert, I suppose.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Oh, no!
Clever.
Number two is a wider movement�a smile goes with that one�like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Amazing.
Here comes a car!
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
You! Don't make me laugh.
What're you going to do?
You might give me a little credit.
What for?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Why not? I'm hungry.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him�
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Come on�get in.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on�
Come on! come on!
What happened?
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!
What'd you give him for the car?
You don't have to eat the carrots.  Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Any luck?
What about money?
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
That's swell!
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
Nope.
Me?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Better go back to your bed.
I love you.
You're forgetting you're married.
I hope you got your money.
You bet I did.
Congratulations.
Same to you.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited�
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
ONE�TWO�THREE�FOUR�FIVE
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
�six�seven�eight�nine�
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and�and scared.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed�  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tired�and it's the only thing around.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Not interested.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
You bet we did.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Whatever you say, darling.
Where's the bus to New York?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus�I told them to wait!
Eight o'clock tonight.
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
When does the bus leave?
In about fifteen minutes.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady�
Husband?
Yes�if he is your husband.
Isn't he here?
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the�
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
But can't you wait until morning�
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff�much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Get out!
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
Oh, by the way�what's your name?
I've been thinking about you.
Yes?
Hey�you not up yet? Come on�come on!
What time is it?
I'm hungry.
The old man's screwy!
What's 'at?
The dame's too smart for him.
What's up?
Any of your passengers want a place to sleep�there's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
Yeah? Where?
Yeah.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Mr. Gordon�
Huh?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Yes.
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that�
Get out of here!
Joe, listen�
Don't "Joe" me.
Okay, Joe. Listen�you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn�anytime I ran into a story that looked good�I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars�and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
What!
Never mind . . . Listen�suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Huh?
That she's going to marry somebody else.
You're drunk.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
I'd put you there myself.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
I am, Joe.
You!
Yeah.
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn�then something comes along�messes up the finish�and there you are.
Yeah, where am I?
When you sober up�come in and see me.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Listen, man�I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
ain't got a hat�
What?
I ain't got a hat.
Yeah.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
Yeah?
What do you reckon that's for?
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
A trumpet?
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
You send telegrams here?
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is�"  No, do you really?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of�of�"
Mush. Mush.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
Send it collect.
Collect?
There you go�trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you�
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
Who?
See that. They're gone!
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Then�you'll have to git !
Not a minute!
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeah.
Zeke.  Git!
Well, you're two up on me now.
Huh?
There's a seat over there for you.
What's the idea?
I'd like to sit with my�uh�wife�if you don't mind.
Wife?
Yeah. Come on�come on!
What's up?
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time.
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
Thanks.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
That's right.
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
Yeah�wouldn't it?
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
What?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Why?
Five G's�or I crab the works.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to�
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Huh?
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Why�no�
Yeah�the "big boy"�the Boss of the outfit.
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see�and�
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with�
Sh-sh-sh�! Soft pedal, you mug!�before I� What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing�and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Yeah ?�How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Orange, New Jersey.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Yeah. Just babies.
You love them, don't you?
Oh, gee, Mister�you wouldn't�you ain't thinkin' about�
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
If you don't�Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
No.
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Right.
Now that's pretty important, Dean. You also told the FBI when you met him, he was six foot two.  Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight.  How the hell did the man shrink like that, Dean?
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Street cats?
What was his voice like?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Did he pay?
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
And Oswald?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
So you saw Oswald how many times?
Recall any names?
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
There were no phone records.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Who?
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Bill.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Yeah, I guess you do.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
No, I'm not...
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
What do you think, Lou?
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
The fact is he's gone, chief, and so's our case.
Yeah.  They were seen together in Clinton in early September.  The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive.
...rumor is Shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement.  No one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. They stood out like cottonballs.  I got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time I checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. We still got the Negro junkie, Vernon Bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near Lake Pontchartrain.  But it's tough, boss - no one wants to talk about Shaw.  He's...
You know you keep saying that.
Keep saying what?
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
What's the other name?
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Did he pay you for this?
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
Go on, Willie.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
But why?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Can you get some sworn statements?
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
All right, all right.  Break it up.
Where you going, boss?
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
What's it look like, Nick?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
I did.
Why?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
...Oswald?
No, I did not.
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
No, I did not.
You know damn well who it is.
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
Calm down, Dave, what?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
What did they...
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
It leads farther than that.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
...give me protection?
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
What do you mean?
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
What was so appealing about Houston?
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
I see.  And where did you drive?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Why Galveston?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
And then Sunday?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I believe the boys got a couple.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Why?  What's wrong?
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Who was paying you, Dave?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
And Shaw?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
What about Ruby?
Then who killed the President?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I had the cause of death.
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
No.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
There were admirals.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
That's our case!
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
Daddy!  Where have you been?
Are we going away, Daddy?
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
I'm scared.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
I want the truth.
...you heard echoes.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
How many shots you say you heard?
Four to six.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
None!  The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel.  He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
I don't believe it!
Aren't you being a little hard?
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
No.  Never heard of him.
A Perry Russo?
No.
A Willie O'Keefe?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
Who?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Let me show you his picture.
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Please answer the question.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
Nonsense.  What next?
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Honey, you all right?
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter.  He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Hi.
Tough day.
My sympathies.
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Did they live?
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
What?
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Get a hold of yourself.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
And if you're wrong?
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
They killed him, honey.
Huh?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
For sexual purposes?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
What's wrong, Lou?
Oh no!... How bad?
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
I know David - a strange character.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
What are you driving at, boss?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Can we find her?
I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
Goddamn Sam!
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Time?
Between six and seven seconds.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
How many men?
Who do you think changed the parade route?
Beats me.  City officials.  Secret Service.  Dallas police.  They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days before.  But they didn't bother running through Dealey.  They stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
Who?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
The Warren Commission call him?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Allen Dulles?
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Are they?  Why would they?
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Jim Garrison?
Yes.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Well, thanks for coming.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
...and your General?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
Ever ask him?
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
His name?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
It never did.
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
More than ten years.
And he never hit you before?
Never touched me.
How much more?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
You have other information?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Was he there often?
Where is Banister in all this?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
The assassination, Jack?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say.
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
She's the best damn witness we have!
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
They've been enlarged and show a lot of detail...
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
Germany.
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
If you must know, virtually nothing.
How many men are working with you on this?
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
That's all you've had all this time?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
And what would I have to do?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Yes?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Virginia.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Six.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
Yes.
Do you walk home?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
What are they?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Can I help you?
This looks pretty good on me.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
I know. That's why I went.
I understand.
I understand.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
I'll call her.
Won't forget?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Who was there for your ass?
You were there for me.
Who?
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
If that's what they want to do, they're doin' it.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
What'd ya mean?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
What?
I need a favor.
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
What's the problem?
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
Uh-huh.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Let me finish. Can I finish?
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
I can't believe you do me this way.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
Look, man, I know I owe you --
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
Does he have the marked bills on him?
Why were you with him?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
How'd you know where he was?
I found out.
And you didn't tell the Police?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
You got a good lawyer?
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Great, you're here.
What's going on?
She wants to make a deal.
She sound scared?
She almost sounds scared.
What's she want?
She wants to go back to work.
What's she willing to give us?
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
She knows it's my case?
We are. Don't worry about it.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Can I have a word with you?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
This is your money?
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
I'm not a loser.
Help yourself.
My pocketbook.
What's in it?
What's this?
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Take your time.
Help us do what?
But now you're telling us now you do.
You don't want much, do you?
How was your flight?
Fine.
What's her name?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
I gave you my card there.
Can I see your I.D.?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.
Is it dark?
It's kind of a sports bar
That doesn't sound dark.
Why does it need to be dark?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
What's your brand?
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
Was she helpful?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You're not tired of it?
What have they told you?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Shit.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
You know who put the dope in your bag?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
Ordell pick up his bond?
Same as you. Ten thousand.
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
I didn't?
No, you didn't. What branch?
He's the one who wants you.
It was the other guy who busted me.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
How many trips did you make?
With ten thousand? Nine.
He's got that kinda money?
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Cash poor?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
What'dya think?
You get a chance to use it?
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Somebody loan it to you?
Want to hear some music?
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
This is pretty.
Uh-huh.
The Delfonics.
'76?
'74, I think.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
Are you?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
How'd you find that out?
He told me last night.
He came by.
What?... What'd you do?
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
Why?
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
How do you get it out?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
How do you feel about getting old?
You're not old. You look great.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's not really something I think about.
Really?
How'd you feel about it?
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
It's different with men.
My ass ain't the same.
Bigger?
Does something else worry you?
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Fifteen thousand.
Well, hello.
I walked right past you.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Catching a movie.
"American President"
How was it?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Does it happen to all men?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
And Annette's it for you?
Who was your girl before Annette?
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
Why?
I'm old enough to be her father.
How old's Annette?
What're you, a bag lady?
I go back to work tomorrow.
You talk them into it?
They seem to like the idea.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Right around here, in the food court.
Will Ordell go for that?
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
He was here?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I called you last night.
You think he's got a thing for you?
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
I see.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Has he hinted around?
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
You know some interesting people.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
He tries to act cool.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
You're avoiding the question.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Why?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
When did you decide?
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
The day you got me out of jail?
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
Got another gun and a stun gun...
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
What do you do when he comes home?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
You do that?
That's my job.
Did you do it that night?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
And is that it?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Which one?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
The feds. It's evidence.
You're rationalizing.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Do you think they bought it?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
It'll be more than that.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Where's the rest of it?
In the bag underneath.
What if he checks it?
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
In a dress.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
He's liable to shoot you.
Ray wants him.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Set him up.
Uh-huh.
Tell him you want to see him?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
What do you tell Nicolet?
He's already there.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
Less ten percent.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I hesitated taking that much.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
What's he doing?
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
That's Ordell's.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I didn't use you, Max.
I didn't say you did.
I never lied to you.
We're partners.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Where're you going?
Spain.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Wanna go?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Who's side are you on?
I beg your pardon?
What if I plead guilty?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
If I don't cooperate?
He say we like the same thing as married.
Most of the times.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
Yes'm.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
He say is a surprise.
Oh, Miss Brown?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
I know what it looks like.
We'll just be a minute.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
We can look into that.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
You know what we want.
Oh, so now you know him?
No shit. You know how he makes his money?
He sells guns.
You ever see him sell guns?
No.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
How can you help us?
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
I'm recording this.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
You talk to him?
Not really.
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
What for?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Not yet.
Who's the other one?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
What's her story?
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
And splittin' with her?
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
She told you that?
Uh-huh.
Was she there?
She didn't say.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uh-huh.
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
You said that the last time.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
You didn't count it?
Ever been tempted?
Uh-huh.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
Yes. All those things are true.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
That would be one point of view.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I thought I did.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
But you didn't do that.
Where's the bag she gave you?
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
What did you do after that?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
There was a guy with Melanie?
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
I have no idea.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
I thought you were watching him.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
What about you?
Do you think I took some of that money?
Oh, hi.
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Sure.
Killian's.
Uh-uh.
How long you been with Ordell?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
What were you two fighting about?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
He said he didn't know about it.
You already knew that?
Kinda.
Dreaming.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Keep it between us girls?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Jackie?
Hi, Melanie.
Are you getting that black suit?
Yeah, do you like it?
Do you got something for me?
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
Thanks.
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
I got some vodka in the freezer.
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
For what?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
They asked.
Beaumont Livingston.
I knew it.
Yeah?
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
What do you think it is?
I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
What the hell you doin'?
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
I understand woman, damn!
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
I just came here to talk.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
Baby, I didn't --
Yeah?
I got a problem...
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
The Cockatoo Inn.
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
I do okay.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
How the fuck they know that?
You told em? You told em it's me?
They already know it's you.
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
It's true, isn't it?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
That's a good idea.
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
Who?
I don't know. One of your friends.
A woman.
If you want.
Yeah, I think a woman.
But you don't?
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
That's the idea.
So we need two people, two women.
Can you cover that?
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Managers get ten percent.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I'll give ya ten.
Plus the same deal as before.
Uh-huh.
Who?
What'd you care?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Drink?
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
I was there, I saw her do it.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Man, I don't like that part.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She don't know shit about the money.
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
Designer clothes.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
Where you gonna be during all this?
Who's paging you?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
It's boring, isn't it?
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Want a hit?
When did you get out of jail?
Susanville.
How long?
Two months shy of four years.
Four years?
Uh-huh.
What for?
Bank robbery.
Is it ready to go?
You okay?
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
Want a Metrix?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
The roller disco one.
You're fourteen years old here?
Yeah.
I thought you were sixteen.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Were you a disco girl?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
So where did you go?
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
No.
Where were you?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
Were you a disco guy?
No.
C'mon, don't lie.
I don't like dancing.
Did you ever go I one?
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
You been to Japan?
I lived there for about nine months.
You lived in Japan, when?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Must of made quite an impression.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
That sounds like a problem.
Wanna fuck?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Is it dead?
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
No.
He went to meet that stewardess.
Please.
You live with him.
Uh-huh?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Uh-huh?
We're leaving now!
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
I'm carrying it.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Yeah, down the end.
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
This one.
Thanks, Baby.
What's your cost?
As low as two.
Are you serious?
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
That's good money.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
What do I do?
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Okay.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
Whatcha watchin'?
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
Guess where I am?
I dunno.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
The moon -- I dunno
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Uh-huh.
C'mon in.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
I'm in my underwear.
Who was that?
That was Beaumont.
Who was Beaumont?
An employee I had to let go.
What did he do?
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
So we on the same page then?
I didn't look like a bum.
How much is there?
Can I ask you about Melanie?
What's your relationship?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
She believed you?
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
What does that mean?
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Uh-huh.
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
It's Louis.
Did you get it?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
So what, you left her there.
You shot Melanie?
Twice. In the parking lot.
Couldn't talk to her?
You know how she is.
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
You shot her twice?
So you're sure she's dead.
Pretty sure.
Where did you shoot her?
In the chest and stomach.
Louis?
What?
How much it there?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
You said five hundred and fifty!
So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
Came outta where?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Then what?
Where you shot her.
That's right.
Fuck you for asking me that.
What'd you shoot her with?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
Maybe the Feds got it.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.

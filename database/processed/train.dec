Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Forget it.
Cameron.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Forget French.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Where?
You're sweet.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
I believe we share an art instructor
Tons
I was?
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
No...
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
No
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
Let's go.
I hope so.
They do not!
No.
You might wanna think about it
Who?
Joey.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Is he oily or dry?
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I did.
Expensive?
Hopefully.
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Can we go now?
You're welcome.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
What?
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
As in...
You did what?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Why didn't you tell me?
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
So did you
You set me up.
I just wanted --
No! I just wanted
It's just you.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
What if she never starts dating?
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
The prom?  Kat has a date?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
You wanna go out with him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
I thought you hated those people.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
No, I ' m not.
Yeah -- we'll see.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Don't make me do it, man
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
Then, go get her
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
Where?
You get the girl.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Not at all
Away.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
What do you think?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
How much?
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget her sister, then.
A deal's a deal.
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
We're not.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Block E?
Just a little.
An attempted slit.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
No fear.
Who cares?
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Seven-thirty?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Hi
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know who The Raincoats are?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
What?
Busy
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
Do what?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
I'm gettin' there
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
BIANCA
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Look up, sunshine
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Maybe.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
I dazzled him with my wit
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Acting the way we do.
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
For. . . ?
Fallacy.
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
I hate peas.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
I didn't care about the money.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
You decided.
Enough!
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Funny.
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No -- impressed.
When I go?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Just smack her now.
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
Right.
Yeah...
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
Good enough.
Just for now.
Yeah.
I'm likin' you guys better
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
Touch of the flu.
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Pirate -- no question.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Dr. Ruth?
But -- who -- what --?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
We'll all go crazy...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Excellency, you are right.
Your life, and that of others!
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The Judgment is ours!
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I find that hard to believe.
Thank God...
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
You don't usually ask.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
I am busy inside.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
Yes... I remember...
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
There'll be a time.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
This time with me!
Not bad.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
No?
NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
I'm not bargaining!
Then you are too ambitious.
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
... for a commoner?
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
Call them.
Look out of that window.
All of them created by people like me.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Island.  Far.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Why?
Chief says -- he has a God.
... and also to bring medicine.
Chief says...
He understands.
Ask him if he will help.
You did the same to your God!
You never learned how to speak my language.
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Esdras is a Jew.
So was Christ!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Damn God!
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
Colon!  Don't!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
Give me absolution.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
New worlds create new people.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
Surely you can do anything you want.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
A woman?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We don't need to know.
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
God be with us admiral.
And what do you think Mendez?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Come over here.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We can't be.
Immediately.
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You think I don't know that?
We're lost!
The land is there.  I know it!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
You tell that to them!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
He must be replaced.
Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
Oh, sure.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What about Oleg?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
No, he is here.  Shit...
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut?  How much?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
But it's...
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Give me another one, please.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Can I see your back?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Yes, but he was a cop.
I will if they don't send me back.
They won't until this is over.
Divorced.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Somewhere else?
So...the station is empty?
Yeah.  This way.
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I know.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
They're not gonna send you right back.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
Right.
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
I'll get my clothes.
Pouring it out!
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Go on.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Who do you think, Chief?!
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
No!  Nothing happened.
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Okay.  But not water sports.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
End my career?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
But Chief?  Over this??
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Yeah, right.
What was that, Korfin?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Yeah.
Vodka tonic.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
You ready?
A timer.
Any I.D.?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
It's okay.
Yeah.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Stay with her.
No.  I'm okay.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
Did you tell him you did?
What are you saying?
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
Describe him.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
No, what is it?
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Who says she's a suspect?
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This isn't homicide school.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
Stay here.
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
I'll call it... tails.
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
I'm on duty.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Is that all there is?
Something back home?
You wanna talk to her alone?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
You know what I'm saying here.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Just a shower?
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
What do you want?
What's your accomplishment.
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Is it drug related?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Okay.
Hey.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Stop it.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
You're ruthless.
You're not so bad yourself.
Could be Leon's.
Answer the phone.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
That's good.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Promise?
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
I love you.
Tonight.
You promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Okay.
See you later.  Good luck.
Thank you.
Don't be late.
Jesus Christ.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
Not what.  Who.
That's unique.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
Keep them out of my way.
Okay.  You ready?
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
I am butcher.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
And what do you do with the bones?
Dog food.
No.  Are you proposing?
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
Tommy, take a walk.
You'll be my first.
Get down on your knees.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Where's Czech girl?
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
Where is escort service?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Yes sir.
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
Yes.
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Is there a problem?
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
He doesn't speak English.
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
In here, says he wants a million.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Yes.  Both.
Okay.
Okay.
I want to document my trip to America.
Don't speak Russian!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
We have no money.  Come on.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Shut up.
Does it hurt?
Don't want to film this?
I did.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Why not?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Sit down!
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Good idea!
Cut!
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Credit?
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
No, I don't get that!
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Did you hurt her?
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Ha. Ha.
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
A job?
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
We started over, you can too.
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
In love?  With who?
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Don't give me that fucking shit.
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Well, he...
I want to hear everything he said.
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright.  Go ahead.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
New York.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A cheap hotel.
What are you coming here to do?
I'm here for movies.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Excuse me?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
That's what it looks like to me.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
No way!  He's mine!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
He's my collar!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Yeah?  What kind?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Clean?
Don't blow your nose!
But you knew that, right?
What??
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Yeah?
How long they been livin' here?
You hear that question, Garcia?
Aren't you tired?
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Not good.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
The clerk?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Don't stoop to his level!
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Your doctor?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
She's wonderful.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay.
Okay, come on down.
Sure, what is it?
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes?
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Yes.
It's possible.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
No. I never did, either.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh?
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, I thought so.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
How?
That's true.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
No.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Yes.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Roger.
He's got a point.
What is it, Hal?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Yes, it is, Hal.
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well, what is it?
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Are you coming to my party?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
When are you coming home?
In three days, darling, I hope.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
How many days until you come home?
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Thank you, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Yes, Daddy.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Thank you.
Well, how's it going back there?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well, that does sound very odd.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Fine.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Are you quite sure?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Really?
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
That's right.
I see.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Fortunately, they did.
Well, I'm glad about that.
Certainly.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
I will if I can, Frank.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Thank you very much, Hal.
Roger.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
I want to pick up my car.
Hammond.
Yeah, I've been busy.
How about chargin' the battery?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Great, just great.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
You got a real big mouth, convict.
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pros.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Goodbye.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Here's hoping, baby...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
Would you guys...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You're gonna help us take him.
No chance.
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
You're done.  End of story.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
You're crazy.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
I'll think about it.
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
No way to start a partnership.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I may call you worse than that.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I'm helpin' you, huh?
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Thank you.
Want to try it again?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
You have a good time?
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
That's never been one of my problems.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
The bet's off.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
Must be billy's girl.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
How much?
Half a million.
Jesus.
He's after your money.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Not likely, convict.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Yeah.  Right.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
You just drove by it.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Shit.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
You stay with me...
No way...
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Hello. And goodbye.
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
So you took the rest of the night off...
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
You sure that's the reason?
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah. Guess not.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Luther's on the move...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Don't worry about it.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Partnership?
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
There's nothin' to talk about.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I'll keep it in mind.
I lost them, that's what happened.
How did they get away?
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
You couldn't get to him?
I didn't have the time.
Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Yeah.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
I'll help you out.
Shit.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
One of  em's in the slam.
So do you...been a long day.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Nothing.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
What?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I don't know.
When? How?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I still don't think it's loaded.
You're hopeless.
What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
I guess he got the message...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Guess people ought to know who I am...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
Jack, are you okay?
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
So am I.
Jack?  What was that?
Jack, wait...
Just a second, that's all!
Hi, it's me...
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
How do you know?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Let's go, Reggie.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Tell me.
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Shrink major, not a shrink.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Shut up.
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Shut up.
What do you want?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Sure, right.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
When?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You chickenshit punk...
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
First, the money.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five bills.
This ain't a credit business.
Give it back.
Try and take it.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Corn-i-Lius?
Napoleon... small.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case was stolen?
You know exactly where they are!
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
No thank you.
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
They are robots!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
I know...
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She dropped in on me... holding this.
I brought the girl remember?
The girl?
You noticed...
So you do know her.
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
I know. I was there when she arrived.
It means, "Never without my permission".
That's what I thought.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Of course.
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
That's what I'm saying.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
And then?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Yes..thank God..
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
Thank you, Mr. President.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
I didn't know your size.
Perfect.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Who?
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I would like to have died in peace...
They are... with me...
Hey bud! Finger here.
I was talking to the cat.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Don't exist bud.
How do I look?
Like shit.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
So, just how big was this fare?
Leeloo..
...'Scuse me?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Vito Cornelius?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...Leeloo.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Hi Ma...
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Yes ma..
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Have you pulled yourself together?
You little sleaze bag!
...Ma???
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Thanks for reminding me..
This is a police control action..
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Found it?
Does it get any better or what!
Uh... not really.
Crystal.
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I don't think this is a good time...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
Got it...
He's on vacation.
Not without Leeloo.
I'll be right back.
It's like a cab isn't it?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
What mission?
To save the world.
Where have I heard this song before?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Just one... why me?
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
And the third one?
I've had enough good news for today
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I'm not going.
Why not?
What is it?
I thought you were divorced.
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Three of us will never fit in there!
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Uh..you're welcome.
Oh god!
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
What is... Make Love?
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
...Hoppi-hoppa.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
You noticed..
OK, you can turn around!
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
It's difficult.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
Protect life... Until death.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...The rain falls...
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I want to sleep... forever...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
...Like love...
Exactly.
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Why?... Why would you need me?
Because...
I love you...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
You're welcome..
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Talk English Doc.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Wonderful!
An elephant couldn't crack it.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
...What do you mean?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
How much time is left?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Perfect, Mr. President.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Options.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
Gentlemen?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Amen..
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Yes, Sir!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
I'm not at the hotel!
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
How's our deal coming along?
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
...I can't wait to be among you.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
Honey, I'm not, please...
I love you.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I know.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Why the gun?
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
I don't know what to say
Don't...
Amy...
Mrs. Christian.
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Tom... she's dead.
I just talked to her.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
What you see is what I got, mister.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What are you talking about?
Bullshit.
I'm telling you...
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Dino...
Nobody knows anything.
I promised him to Machine.
What can I do for you today?
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
Hmm.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Is it?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
And they are?
I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Machine.
If it's not him, there's no deal.
We can do that.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Machine's in?
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Where are the women?
They should be here any minute.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Sure.
What are you... ?
Take out your gun!
Look, I don't know what this...
Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
I remember him.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Bring the film, or we kill him.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Move it, dirtbag... !
Leave him alone.
Fuck off.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You betrayed us.
Call me Tom.
Alright, Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I figured you share information.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Why don't they come to me?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
I'm not so sure about this.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Any good?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
It's good what you're doing.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
How'd you find me here?
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
It was a lot of fucking money.
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Why?
Because we're going there.
You enjoy it?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
What did you do with her body?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Show me.
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Don't think I won't.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Look, you cocksucker...
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Fuck you!
I'm listening.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You are a private investigator?
That's right.
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
I was well compensated.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Never mind how I found you.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
They're no friends of mine.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Shut up.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You're asking me why?
I'm asking.
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Enlighten me.
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
Fuck you.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Yeah... guess so.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Pardon me?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Good for you.
Three, four years.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Max.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
There's not much illegal.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
I'm not a cop.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
Not quite.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
How much?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Sounds good, pops.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Interesting theory.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
Child pornography.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
Twenty-five.
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
What about me?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A daughter.
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Good question.
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
You're learning.
Where does he sell it?
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
Alright, I get the picture.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
See ya.
Great.
It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
Who is he, his name?
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Nope.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
I try to be.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Thank you.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
My condolences.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
He succeeded.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Just curious.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
I'm afraid I don't...
This is a movie showing a girl being murdered.  She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife...  I only watched what I could.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
No.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm telling you it's not that.
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
I told you I can't, not yet.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
It won't work like that.
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
The checks were for odd amounts...
Okay, I follow you so far...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
You're joking.
To the penny.  Exactly one million dollars in cash.
I'm here.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box.
Okay.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
You told me to look, so I looked.
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
How are you?  Having any luck?
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I hope it's nothing serious.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
Fine...
If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
I don't understand, who are... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Yes, but...
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
Neil... Neil Cole.
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
No.
Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
That's exactly what I am.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
No.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
What was she running from?
I don't know.
Yes.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Why do you think he did it?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I didn't mean to...
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
Okay.
We're all like that.
Are you religious?
No.
You should be.
What?
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Do you think the police did a good job?
I don't know.  I think so.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
Will you let me look?
You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
Yes.
It's been six years.
What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I remember.  You just left...
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
What... ?
Who is this... ?
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
Who are you?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
No...
No... no... no...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
Yes.  I remember her.
Those are her belongings.
Her belongings?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
I'll do what I can.
None too discreet, is he?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Cash.
No, you may not.
Okay.  Fine.
Certainly, sir.
What?
I don't want to.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
What's wrong?
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
What?
Kristen...
It was bad.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't find him.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Then we'll stay up together.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
You could do worse.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
I know.
We have matching luggage.
What?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
Saw who? I was up all night cramming for this physics test, and I was putting this little baby together.  Look...
You're his sister, right?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
I know.  Uh...Alice.
It was no suicide.  It was not an accident.  It was Freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
"In her dream"?
Extra money, huh?
Look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Is there something we can do?
I don't think so.  I guess this is my own war.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
You just feel sorry for me.
Cut that shit out.  Maybe before, but not now. I want to help you. I'm on your side.
It's okay, we're just about there.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Save it for later.  Come on!
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Earth to Alice...
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Nice neighborhood.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
She knew she was gonna die.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
About Freddy?
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
What?
Oh God!  He killed them!
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
You had a nasty bump.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Don't worry, honey
It's okay, Dan
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
And ours.  It's our grandchild.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
You're not taking my baby!
Huh?
It's lonely in there, in my room.
My name is...
How did you know that?
I could tell you were sad.  I just wanted to see if you were all right.
Been having bad dreams.
No...
She doesn't want me around
Who said I...wait, what?
My friend, with the funny hand.
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
He's inside you, where he hides.
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Sorry, babe.
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
I know.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
Yeah...I guess.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
You're right.
There you go.  Love you.
Me too.
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
No.  A deal's a deal.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
To take a picture.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
It's just across the park.
Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
Sobering...
Very funny.
Alice...
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Since my little girl became a mom...
You disappointed in me?
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
I've got to go.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
But Dad --
Now.
Had kind of a long night.
No, the Dan part was nice...
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Why don't you two stick to reality.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
Krueger is reality.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
So did Dan.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Well we gotta do something!
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Mark!
Nobody thinks that.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
My baby!
What, you named it already?
I don't know!
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
Then we'll find another way.
That's their problem.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Meaning?
But I've seen her grave.
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
No shit.
She killed herself.  Her soul's gonna be in torment.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
My undying love.  Have some.
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Who?
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Makes you look like a nun--
Yeah...
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
All of us.  Right?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Faint.
Mark...
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
Stick around, please?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
How is he - ?
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
My father!  He's not - ?
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
I'd sooner swim!
Yes?
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
But if they <u>do</u>?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Helen.  I appeal to you -
So they caught up with you, too?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
<u>That's</u> the worst possible moment?
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Disappointing a <u>big</u> girl!
Huh?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
A lot of people think like that.
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
Sounds like it!  Distress call, from a small freighter, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. One mayday, then...nothing.
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
'Us?'
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
I think you're right.
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
Listen!  Hear that?
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
Somewhere down there?
We'll have to look for them later.
I'm with <u>you!</u>
Oh it does???
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Right, Skipper.
What about down?
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
What???
Right at our one-eyed friend!
The frogmen?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
We hope!
All internal repairs completed, and Frogmen report exterior damage minor.
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Why do you say that?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
What????
Wonderful!
That's wonderful, Carl!  Reef thinks they can clear the Shark bow so we can pull ourself loose!
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Anything ---
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
What about time...?
Under <u>water</u>?
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
What direction does the system indicate?
There's got to be an explanation!
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Who with?
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
Huh?
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
But - what can we accomplish?
We can <u>ram</u> him!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
What?
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Nothing we can do, now.
Minus three.
Come where?
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
- for horrors like yourself?
Your friend was to remain where he was!
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Why?
I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
Obviously.
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Thank you.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
I'll be another!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Toward the Pole!
All right - go to it.
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
No. Black.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Who?
Evan Twombley, the union boss who got shot. Somebody murdered him.
Who?
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Twombley involved?
No.
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
Same old shit.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Yeah. I know about that.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
Chub says you're fired.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
This spring.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Oh.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Yeah.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You can't buy Wade off.
We bought you.
That was me.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Guaranteed, eh?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Damn straight!
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
If you get it?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Follow close. We'll cross the next meadow.
Yeah?
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
Oh.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Really.
They said.
What happened?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
This way.
Sun's gettin high.
Deers have ears too.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Not here.
Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
How'd you get the job?
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Shit.
Piece of fucking cake.
In the chest.
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
On your sleeve.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
Sure you did.
What?
Saw him do it?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
He sure as hell won't.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Open the door. We're late.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Yeah.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
I don't care. They're out.
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
Do what?
You know.
Yeah. It's stupid.
I guess they're stupid.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
Was it funny?
To us it was.
But it's not funny now.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
What are you talking about?
I just think you used to be bad.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
I don't want to.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
It's not that.
What then?
It's stupid.
It's fun.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
No.
No what?
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
I called Mommy.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.
Jesus, why?
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yes.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Yes.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
It's pretty old.
Pop?
Grandpa. My father. It's his.
Oh.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
No.
What do you want, then?
Nothing.
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Fine.
What are you sorry for?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
I want to go home.
You can't.
I know.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Oh.
Okay, let's go home, then.
Got here just in time. Go ahead. Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a prize.
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Where's the plow?
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Huh?
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
Don't go playing policeman.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
You don't want the extra police pay?
I'm not saying that.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
Fuck you.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
I figured you already heard.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You mean Twombley?
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Like hell.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
I'm fine, fine.
You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
On what you pay me?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You? Why?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
Want to buy?
Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
I won't. You interested?
Could be.
Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
The key, Wade.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Where's Jill?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Yeah.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We should talk.
It's just...
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Yeah, lots.
See. Get your boots.
Hi honey.
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Did you get his number?
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
Mel Gordon.
I still don't understand --
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
For a while.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
See you tomorrow, maybe.
You okay?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Said what?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
Forget it.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
Yeah. I mean that.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
Tonight. Let's get together.
Okay.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Jack doesn't need money.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
But not now.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
What way?
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
It's nice.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Then... I guess you have to.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Oh, Wade.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
You've been married twice --
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Good.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
I know your parents.
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Think they're alright?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Wade.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Look, that's temporary, believe me. There's so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days, my getting fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't matter a bit.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
When did she die?
Is...? She's dead then?
Can --?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
How's that?
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Hold on!
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Can't it wait, then?
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
What?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
This town sucks.
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
That goddamned woman. Thinks she can cart Jill off and leave me alone like this. I'm more than pissed, Margie. I'm a whole lot more than pissed. I been that plenty and I know the difference. This is different.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
Jack?
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
His office. You mean my old office.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
He got his deer yet?
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
Atta-go.
Nothing.
You no-good pup!
Sleeping.
You remember Margie Fogg?
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
Yeah.
She's coming.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
In the living room.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Love! I'm made of love!
Call it what you want.
Everything you know is from me.
Bang!
You and me.
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Who?
Twombley.
No shit.
You think Jack shot him?
Well, it was an accident.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Who?
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Yeah. I forgot.
What about her?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Want to know what I think happened?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
I don't know. You tell me.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
A hunting accident is perfect.
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
Not particularly.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
Yeah.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Well, I never heard that one.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
That's what you think.
Wade, are you alright?
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
For what?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Yeah, no duh.
I'm sure he's busy.
Don't you even want to ask?
Alice...
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Back at The Fishbowl?
No, it's okay.  After all, he is the President, right?
Your father never means to be so...
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Some kids were teasing you?
That's not really the point.
Yes dear?
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
Jim... for godsake!
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
It would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
You are a resilient man, Mr.
Hey, you guys back already?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Daddy...
Alice... I...
Been better, Dad... You?
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
Did we warn them off?
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
You read my mind.
He's busy being dead.
I'm doing what I can.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
Stay cool.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
We don't know that.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
I prefered the terrorists.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. It may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
Yes, Mr. President.
Why?
Because it is my duty.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
My loyalty was never to my country.
About goddamn time.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Roger.
Ga get it.
Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
Dead.
How many others killed?
Nine.
Any of us?
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
A secret service agent. It must be.
why did they do that?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Well it worked.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
We're not going to make it.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
Stand by.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
Tower, here.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Copy, Air Force One.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
A dubious distinction, no?
I guess it depends on your perspective.
Conference rooms, though some have other functions.  The one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
Thank you.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Scared. We're scared.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
What do you want with us?
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
Come on, Alice.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
What do you know of my husband?
I know he left you behind.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
How can you? I mean they're people.
That was war.
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
No.
Say something dear.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Jim...
Three...
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Over my dead body.
No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Good. Good.
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
One thing I've learned as
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
Hold on, Alice.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes?
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
They've gotta be joking.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
Gravity.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
Got it.
Yes, sir.
That isn't necessary.
Can't it wait?
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
And when have I had five minutes? When I wake up in the morning and I'm already three hours behind Schedule.  What do you want me to do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off because I'm a family man?
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I wish it were that easy...
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
Please... don't start with me.
Both of you.
Flying the plane.
Excuse me?
The fax machines.
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
White House Situation room.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
Then tell me there's a rescue operation underway.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
We're handling it, sir.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
who can I say is calling?
This is the President.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
Thank you for calling the white House...
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
I might still have a few chips left.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Other way around, sir.
Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Did we tape the Duke game?
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
That's my job.
Yes, sir.
Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Twenty-five years.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
We're hooked. Hove into position.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
Commissioner.
I just wish it was that simple.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I was reading too.
What's the story?
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
What is it, Mary?
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Accelerators down.
You better check it, Unger.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Sir?
You better take this.
Te...!
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Ask Simon.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Who's that, Ted?
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
If that's the way you want it.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
Elaine, we have to go back.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
I'd use the word insane.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Ted!
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Ted, please be careful.
Not now, Elaine.
I mean until we start to burn up.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
You mean...
What will happen to him, Ted?
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Set!
Now!
Compute!
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
I mean for Ted.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
I'm so excited, Simon.
I guess this is a first for you.
No, I've been excited before.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
So mentally ill?
Don't be too long.
I think so.
That's my girl.
Roger.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Can't we change course?
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Maybe.
Simon, what are you saying?!
Yes, sir.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
Negative.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Negative.
That's not possible.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
That's okay, ROK.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Go ahead.
You have great tits.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Request; life support systems check.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Can I hold him?
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
I don't want to hear that word!
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
All right.  Here.
What...?
I don't want to live anymore.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
What?
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
You're sure?
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
Just poached on toast.  Over.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Sixteen 'C', why?
He's carrying a bomb.
A b...
What should I say?
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Yes.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Don't try to stop me!
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Then Elaine was right.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
No.  I mean your relationship.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
Thank you. Cream?
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
No. I'm all alone.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Surely you can't be serious.
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Surely there must be something you can do.
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
I can't tell.
Well...not for another two hours.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
That's right.
Yes. Yes, of course.
A hospital? What is it?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Certainly.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
No.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
Well...
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
You expect me to believe that?
But if you'll just give me...
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I love you, Elaine.
I love you.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
And a little ice.
And a little ice!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
Yes?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
The gear is down.
Uh-huh.
Hello.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
You promise you'll write.
Every day.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Good-bye, darling.
Yes, Captain?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
What is it?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Here.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
I'm Randy.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh, I'd love to.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
I will, but Jim won't.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Huh?
Huh?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
Yes?
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Of course.
Thank you.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
No. No thank you.
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Would you go up, please?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Todd?  Todd doesn't know either.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
I like my horizons narrow.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Yeah...
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
Show me.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
You don't have squat.
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
Yes...
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
Sergeant... Detective.  I wasn't aware there were any Newcomers at the rank of Detective yet.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
He didn't recognize me.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
Here?
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Nice signal, dickwad!
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Yes.
Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner.  You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit.  It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts.  Understand?  Okay.  Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it.  As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable. Although I--
Great.  Well, I'm sure glad that's settled, aren't you?
Nothing.
Nothing?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
And that fits?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Did you learn anything?
A week ago two men came to see her husband.  After they left, he was very frightened.  She identified one of the men from a photo I showed her.  It was Hubley.
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Did you talk to him?
He has not been home since that day. But she told me where to find him.
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Why'd I do what?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
At the end of the bar.
Uh, Matthew...
Back off, George.
But I-- .
I'll handle it.
Screw me?  That can't be right.
That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
Stay back!  I'm okay.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
When will Strader return?
My wife?  She worries about me.
You are married?
Was.  Divorced.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
It's like having an eleventh finger removed.  It hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
In the other man's rectum.
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
Ta ss'trakyona'...
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Why?
Please, I must get out here.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Stop the car!
Thank you.
Nothing.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
You must leave me alone on this.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
How potent?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
We?  You've taken it?
We all did.
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
Ss-ai!
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
... It's Harcourt.
Harcourt is dead.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Tell me about it...
We can't let him get away.
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
But there's no more drug.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
You look very good.
What is it?
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Only holds five.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
No... two.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Who else can I ask around here?
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
For you, anything.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
I'm sorry, Matt.  Nothing here seems to be matching up...
Sure.  Just a minute.
Ss'kya'ta'.
What's that?
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Yeah, I heard of it.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Come on.  You got nothin' better to do, cushy county job like yours.
The human?
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
Yeah.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Yeah, I'll bet.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
Did he find anything?
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Departmental policy.
You?
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Don't tell me what to think.
It is.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
What?
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Whatever gave you that idea?
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
I can't!  Do you mind!
I'll cover you!  Get outta there!!
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Would you, Sir?
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
Uh, seems to be in front and behind.
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Say again?  All after incinerators?
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Yes.  That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Could it be intelligent?
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
How long until it blows?
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
What?
See you soon.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
I get the picture.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
Hear me out...
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
That's right.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
If I go.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Spare me, Burke.  I've had my psych evaluation this month.
No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
That's the plan.  My word on it.
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
She's right.
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
Why not?
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Bullshit!
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Corporal Hicks!?
This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command.  Right?
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
Now, wait a second --
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
Dead on all channels.
It's insured.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
I don't know.
Proceed inside.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
So?  So?
Shut up.  Just shut up!
They're but off!  Do something!
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Forget it.
Sir?
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
What's the question?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
...We're coming in.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Alive?
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
You tell me.  I only work here.
Sure, Hicks.
Are you finished?  You okay?
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Do it!
Let's get these things lit.
Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
Fuckin' A!
Poor bastard.
About seventeen days.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
On my way.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
We didn't miss anything.
Stand back.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
We ain't going anywhere.
Don't be long, Ellen.
No.  Have you?
Fuck you.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
Hudson, give us a break.
You're just reading me.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Uh, what's next?
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Just get back here!
Seal the door.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
It's readin' right.  Look!
Yeah.  What?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
So what do I tell this guy?
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Terrible.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
No.. I've slept enough.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
What about me?
Why not?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
They're dead.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
You promise?
And hope to die?
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
You're really something, ace.
I'm sorry, Newt.
I don't want to...I have scary dreams.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
Did one of those things grow inside her?
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
No, it's different, honey.
Did you ever have a baby?
Yes.  A little girl.
Where is she?
Gone.
You mean dead.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
I know, honey.  Me too.
Look!
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Sure.  Go left.
Newt, wait!
Right here, baby.  Right here.
That's right.
Can we dream?
It did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
What are you talking about. What people?
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
Sweet Jesus.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!

At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
Certainly!
These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it.
What do you mean?
Good morning.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Yes.
No.
How do you know?
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Why not?
Where?
What's that?
A brothel.
Oh!
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
Perhaps.
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
What?
Well, what does it matter to you?
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
You were sublime.
What did you think of the music?
Extremely clever.
Meaning you didn't like it.
What?
Don't bother.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
No, she's fine.
I'm so relieved.
What??
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Hardly.
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Sir -
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
And how will you make him keep it?
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
You have leave to try.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
How much provocation am I to endure from you? The more license I allow you, the more you take.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Then try harder, Mozart. I have no intention of dismissing you. You will remain in my service and learn your place. Go now.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Where?
I want to go back to Vienna.
Now?
Yes!
Why?
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
What are you talking about?
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Where?
Fartsbishop!
Why not?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
That's stupid.
Why? People fart backwards.
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Em iram! Em iram!
No, I'm not playing this game.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
No!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
What?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Eat
Yes.
Eat my - ah!
Of course.
Oh, leave me alone.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Yes!
Well, don't do that again!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Don't be stupid.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
No!
Yes!
I love you! I love you!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Wolfi!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
What does she want?
I don't know.
Well, ask her!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Oh, damn!
Stanzi!
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
Wolfi.
Yes, my love?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
What?
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Why not? Half the house!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Oh, Stanzi.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
No one.
I heard voices.
I'm not telling you.
You'd think I was mad.
Why?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
I can't write it!
Why not?
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Madame. How can I help you?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
He's terribly busy, sir.
I understand.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Really?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
I see.
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Originals?
Yes.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Oh, thank you, sir!
Tonight?
Alone.
What for?
Some service deserves service in return. No?
What do you mean?
Isn't it obvious?
But! I'm a married woman!
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
What?
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Why you?
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He asked me to stay.
And I'm asking you -
No. I was assisting him. He asked me.
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here.
Where's our friend?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
I hope so. I need it immediately.
Leave him alone!
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
He's doing his best.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
Oh, yes.
When, may I ask?
In three months! Papa.
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Do you hear him? Do you?
Be careful!
Behold!
Hey!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Gertrude!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
Michael!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Wine?
Who was your teacher?
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
It's just a trifle, of course.
Majesty.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
Let's have some fun.  Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice.
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
Your Highness.
Yes?
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Sire.
Well. There it is.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Why not?
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Really?
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Well, look at them.
No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
What? On one hearing only?
I think so, Sire, yes.
And German?
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
What do you mean, Sire?
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Enchanted, Madame.
Twenty-six.
Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna.
Thank you, Sire!
What is it?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Ah! By all means.
Yes, Sire.
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Who told you this, Majesty?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece.
Ah, love again.
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
I have no idea.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Well. There it is.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.
I will.
Is she not here?
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Don't you have a maid?
How is your financial situation?
It couldn't be better.
That's not what I hear.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
They say you're in debt.
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
How many pupils do you have?
Pupils?
Yes.
How many?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
It's a secret.
You don't have secrets from me.
It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is!
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
This is just a game, Papa.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
No one calls you that.
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Good morning, sir.
What have you got for me today? Let me see.
I will, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Bene! Bene!
Bene.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Not that I've seen.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
Yes what?
In there, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Why? What has happened?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
What medicine?
I don't know. He has pains.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Is he working?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Opera? Opera!
Are you sure it's an opera?
That's right.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
What?
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Sssh! Stay here.
That kind of music should be punishable by death.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I liked the horse.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Animals?
I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long  - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle.
German!
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
So there you are. What do you say?
Put it down!
What is this?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Yes.
Why not?
Well, we can.
So let me see it. Where is it?
What? Ha-ha! That's funny - I like it. Which one, eh? You're a funny fellow.  Hannah! Come this way.
Madame.
Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
What for?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
My answer is no, Mozart.
Really?
Mio caro Adone.
A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
But this is absurd!
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Whom did they choose?
Herr Sommer.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth.
You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
Of course not.
Do you have a daughter?
I'm afraid not.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Ah. Italian?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
What exactly are you working on?
I can't say. Really
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
Really? Why?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
You burned the score?
How fortunate.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
But what is it they don't like?
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
How could I not?
Did my work please you?
How could it not, Excellency?
Yes?
I never knew that music like that was possible.
You flatter me.
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
What work?
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
Who are you?
How much?
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
Are you neglecting my request?
No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
No, no. I have to get back. I have -
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
You mean she's not coming back?
No, please.
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
This is only a vaudeville.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Do you mean that?
I do.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
Are you ill?
The doctor thinks I am. But -
What?
I'm too young to be so sick.
No! No, it's him!
Who?
The man. He's here.
What man?
Finish what?
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Would you? Actually, you could.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Of course.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
A Mass. A Mass for the Dead.
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
Consigned to flames of woe.
Do you believe in it?
What?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Oh, yes.
Strange!
Come. Let's begin.
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
What time?
Common time.
Yes.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
I think so.
Sing it back.
Yes.
Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
With the tenors.
Also identical?
Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
I think so.
Show me.
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes!
You go fast!
Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I'm not leaving you.
I am so ashamed.
What for?
I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
I think you'd better.
Exactly.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
But, Your Majesty -
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Certainly, Herr Director.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Exactly. A dance.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
What is what?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
On the contrary.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Who is on this committee?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Mozart -
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
Baron!
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
So?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
What do you want?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me.
How well are you trained in music?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Where?
Then you must know this.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
I regret it is not too familiar.
Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Ah - you've heard that?
All Vienna has heard that.
And do they believe it?
Is it true?
Do you believe it?
Should I?
He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered.
Did you try?
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
You cannot say that!
No? Was Mozart a good man?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
Yes.
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
I did.
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
What difference does that make?
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Oh my son, my poor son!
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Yes?
Italian?
Exactly.
He's setting that play to music?
Yes.
You must be mad.
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Never mind.
Incredible.
The Emperor has given him permission.
About the ballet.
Ballet? What ballet?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Yes, in the third act.
Well done, Sire!
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
What? Who the devil are you?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
I can't wait.
What do you mean - now?
Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
I agree, Baron.
Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Who is she?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Excuse me, my dear.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Come with me. And stay in the room.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
But he's all right?
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Bene.
I'll call tomorrow.
Yes.  And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
The American? Yes, duck.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
Thank you.
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Dr. Hirsch?
Go about your duties.
Yes, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor?
What exactly did he call out?
He said 'Jack'.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
What happened to them?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Yes, I believe he did.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Yes.
What did he say?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Warn him?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Yes.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
And what else?
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Dr. Hirsch?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
What shall we do?
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
No, why?
No, not really.
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
Tea would be nice.
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
I beg your pardon?
It was a wolf.
What?
A wolf.
Yes?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
How is that?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Sorry.
Call me Alex.
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Right.
Will you give me a break?
I thought you were asleep.
I was. What are you reading?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
Do you like it?
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
Twenty-eight.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Shall I read to you?
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Yes, go on.
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
That's easy enough.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
Will you come with me?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Will you think about it?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Not just a patient -- me.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Now I'm embarrassed.
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
A werewolf?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Your dead friend Jack?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Very nice.
Charming.
Bathroom.
Lovely.
The bedroom.
There is only one bed.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
It's nice to see you.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Of course.
Good.
I was awake and he was in my room.
But, David.
I wasn't hallucinating.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Do me an enormous favor?
Anything.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Okay.
I've left those pills for you.
A doper werewolf.
See you later.
I'm freezing.
The zoo?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Don't you remember?
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
I should be committed.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Pull over.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
David, stop!
Jack is dead!
Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
What?
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Will you shut up!?!!
David, let's go now.
David, don't lose control.
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
No.
No what?
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No.
No.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
No.
Right.
No.
No what?
No!
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No.
I thought not.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Chart says he's from New York.
I think he's a Jew.
Why on earth do you say that?
I looked.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You did, did you?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
There's no call for that kind of language.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Now see here young man.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Why are you doing this to me?
No, but we're about to.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
No. You've had your chance.
That's very funny, that is.
You could have told them!
I was having a nightmare.
What time is it?
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Alex?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
What are you going to see?
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Some, everyone does.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Bambi?
You're in a hospital in London.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
Two weeks?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
So they said.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Yes.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Did you see Jack?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I really don't know.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Yes.
Good.
David.
You're not having a good time are you?
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Right.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
She's a jerk.
You're talking about the woman I love.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
I don't know.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
She says she 'likes me too much'.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
I assume full responsibility.
Okay.
Shall we?
Nice to see you.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Look at that.
It's a five-pointed star.
You ask them.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Right.
Wrong.
You ask them.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Apparently so.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Beware the moon?
Come on, I'm freezing.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
I heard that.
What was it?
Yeah?
A coyote.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Pecos Bill.
Heathcliffe.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
No, but he was on the moors.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Yeah.
I don't know. Come on.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
It's circling us.
Plan?
Let's just keep walking.
Do you think it's a dog?
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Walk away, Jack.
Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
No.
Not far enough. Come on.
Yeah.
Where are we going?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
Are you going to help me up?
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I can't stand it.
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Life mocks me even in death.
What?!
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
I'm not listening!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Will you be quiet?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Stop it, Jack.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
Nurse!
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Nurse!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
I wanted to see you.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Get out of here, Jack!
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
A monster. I know, I know.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
Jack, are you really dead?
What do you think?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
You must believe me.
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
I will not accept this! Now go away!
Hi, David.
You don't have to say anything.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Thank you.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
What about the zoo?
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
I want you to meet some people.
Hello.
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
How shall I do it?
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
Why don't we ask him?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Send them in.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
What here?
He's on the telephone.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Sorry, love.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
No.
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
Then you have some hot tea?
No.
Oh.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
I beg your pardon?
I'd like some tea, please.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
And what, Sergeant?
I don't rightly know, sir.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
We'll find him, not to worry.
You here again? What do you want?
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I want to know why .
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
But listen, Tom, I�
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Why not?
Yes - sure�
Yeah - sure!
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
No kidding?
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Where's Matt?
Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
He has?
Yeah.
About twenty-four thousand.
It was more than that last week.
Yeah.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Charlie!
Yeah?
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Aw, nerts!
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
I remember once when your account checked.
Yeah.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
Yes, sir.
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust�
What good will that do?
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
What about?
We'll discuss that in the board room.
What do you mean, help?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes�
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
That's very simple. I was home.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Oh!
You understand?
Why, of course.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
It's one of the boys from headquarters. He always sings "Mother Machree" whenever he's got good news. Looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
All right, Jack, all right.
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she�
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Fifty thousand dollars!
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
Get out, get out!
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
I haven't got it.
I'm sorry, Dude, but�I�
That don't do us any good.
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
You don't have to do nothing.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
know, but�
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Why, I needed a�
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
Me?
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Well, you can. You always could.
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
What is?
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Line?
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
See, we're getting along famously!
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Well�
Well, what?
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Now Phyllis, if you don't invite me, I'm coming anyway.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Why are you so anxious?
Don't you know?
No.
I want to be near you!
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer�
Cyril!
My apartment.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals�  I think I will have a drink.
Good for you. Come on.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
Yes, sir.
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Now?
Yes, now.
Oh, yeah?
It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
This is my business. Mr. Dickson's been like a father to me.  What has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Much better this morning, thank you.
Got a handkerchief?
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Thank you!
Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes.
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
The theatre?
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Yes, of course.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn�
The girls!  I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Well . . .
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Happy now?
No.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Why - well, I�
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Directors, eh? Long faces?
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Yes, sir.
Where is he now?
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Now don't you worry about it.
Yes, sir.
Numbers? No, never mind.
Good morning.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Sampson . . .
All right. Send him in.
Yes?
Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
Yes, thank you.
Hello, Helen.
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Why, I don't know.
You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
Sure, I think it's swell.
Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Well, I�
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
There you are.
I can't tell you.
You're protecting somebody.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is�
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and�
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
But I haven't . . .
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson�
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
If he can do it, yes.
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they�
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
He's just confessed. He's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
Yes, sir.
What are you talking about?
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
Yes, sir.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.
Mine too?
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
What'll we do?
I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
Don't you think I know it?
Yes, sir.
Is it safe?
Absolutely.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
He's at a board meeting.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
I'm afraid so.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
No.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Hardly.
All right.
Matt, come here!
Why?
Oh, is that so?
With what?
The ten dollars.
Oh, ten dollars�
Yes.
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Oh, Matt.
Yeah, swell.
Yeah.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Well . . . ?
Well, he was making love to her.
I tell you, I saw them!
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Oh, Charlie again.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Oh now, don't be silly.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that�
All right, dear.
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
They must have turned him down.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Mr. Williams . . .
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Yes, why?
He was here?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
Are you sure?
Yes, sir.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Dude Finlay?
Yes, sir.
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
It was late, I know. The Dooley sisters was already in. They work at a show, you know.
Huh?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
Was it twelve o'clock?
It couldn't have been earlier?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
wasn't anywhere near this place�
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
I don't know.
Yes.
What time did you get in?
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Yes.
Then where were you?
Okay, Matt.
I'm okay, Matt.
You've got enough?
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Bought himself a pocketbook!
I guess so.
Where's Charlie?
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Jim Younger, I told you--
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Now you tell us.
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Never a good thing.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
That was two hours ago.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
You stay out of this, Bob.
How?
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
What?
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
Leave me alone, Bob.
What have you done?
I ain't done --
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Swear.
I swear --
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
He's not bad at it.
It's tougher than it looks.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Nope.
Then I love it.
... Will Perry ...
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
Oh no...
He just lost his temper a little.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
The Army can hang him.
Tomorrow.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Two.
Exactly.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
Hey!
"Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's planning a job.
What?
Tell me.
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
I think I recognize you.
How?
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
I could use the walk.
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
You're not scared, are you?
Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that.
What is wrong with you?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
She got two of them.
She was European!
All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
It was exciting.
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
Yeah.
So what do we do, General Lee?
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
Perfect, Cole.
Let's ride.
Sorry.
Don't let it happen again.
I got three.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
Twenty?!
Sure, cousin.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Yep.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
What will be?
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
What are you saying?
You're forgetting who's in charge --
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
A bad idea.
I got us through the War all right.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
And I'm the better outlaw.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
A trap.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Pass me some whisky.
I'm out.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Missed you too, cousin.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
You ride like a Comanche.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Well?
I'm thinking...
Both would be nice.
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Which one, right or left?
The brown one.
Sadie was not a man!
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Ah.
Get buckets!
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
They gonna rush us?
They're just insurance in case we run.
Of course!  Uh, sir?
What?
Where is Jesse James?
This here is the Younger Gang!
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
The District Marshall
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Ho-yah!
Me get heap firewater --
You're right, sir.
On account of we're robbing it.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
It's a secret.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
So?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
I had you covered.  From back there.
Shit.
My little Web did that?
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
Died a hero.
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
It's fine by me, Jesse.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
I think he's already feeling better.
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
So we got a plan?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Mm-hmm.
Such as?
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
That would have made an impression.
I figure.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
I reckoned.
Hell of a war.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
You're doing just fine.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
What kind of story are they going to believe?
Maybe, maybe...
You can shut up now.
You are a charmer.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Heard of him.
Damn. All that reading paid off.
What do you think?
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Ma.
Don't care.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're gonna have to talk...
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
Bob's upset.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
And we're good at it.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
You've killed your fair share of men.
If I could go back to farming --
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
We're doing this for Ma.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
Oh yeah.
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
No, I --
Got any ideas, little brother?
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Yeah.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Yeah, Jimmy?
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
That he was.
They're making him a hero now.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
Can't argue that.
So what was he?
I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
Yeah Jimmy?
How much of that story is true?
Everything but the boring parts.
Say your prayers?
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Boys?
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Shush.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But you got big!
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
Mmmm.
Nuh-huh ...
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
You're sick of my company?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
What?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
You didn't want to farm?
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
A river pirate.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
And what's this right girl like?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Where will you find such a girl?
Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Sparkling rocks?
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Yep.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
Me neither.
Let the law --
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Let me see that.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Swimming. Swimming is good.
What?
If you don't see it, it's not real...
Yes ma'am.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
You are a hell of a woman.
Don't swear.
Yes ma'am.
I'll explain on the way.
But I like the presidential suite.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
That's the idea.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
Pity.
Last February?
Mmm.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
Yes?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Damn.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
I figured.
Was it worth it?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
That's what I would have done.
You cocky little bastard.
No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Fair enough.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Right here in church?
Communion.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
And the same age Web was. No.
No.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
You been with a girl ever?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
I think so.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
I swear.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
You do that.
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
This time we'll make an exception.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Lyla Devereux.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
That is so gentlemanly of you.
Really?
Don't talk about it much, though.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
They had to be dealt with!
By burning down their homes?
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
Move you fools!
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Really!
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Good.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Yes sir.
Just perfect.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
How much did they get from the safe?
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
We did.
What is going on here, man?
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
I look forward to seeing it.
Sir?
What is that?
What, sir?
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
I remember you.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
I want them arrested and hanged!
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
This is no game.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
It is a nice piece of writing.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
Oh, that's the best part.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
So you can't tell me anything?
It's going to be a long winter.
I can't believe this.
I demand action.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
Can't you tell me anything?
It's going to be a long spring.
No.
In English, Pinkerton.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Can you put men at all four?
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
What is that?
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Stop it. I'm...
On a lot of lithium?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Pumpkin?
Yes?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Uh huh.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
I know. Stop it.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Dorsia's nice.
Nice?
You like it there, don't you?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Eight?
Pick me up?
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
Are we here?
Yes.
This is Dorsia?
Yes, dear.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Is it a what?
Pull out.
Pull out, goddamnit!
What do you want, Courtney?
Turn the light on.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Take it off.
Why?
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip �  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
Oh God, just get it over with.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
That's nice.
You and...Luis?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
I never knew you smoked.
You never noticed.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Yes, Courtney?
Yes?
Nothing.
You just haven't been looking.
Would you like to see my apartment?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Do you take American Express?
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
I don't think so.
Alright.
Well, I actually might need a little surgery after last time.
Really?
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here.
It's not that nice.
Do...what.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Yes, darling?
Is your Evian spiked?
We should do it.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
It's not.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
Yes, I am.
But what about the past? Our past?
We never really shared one.
You're inhuman.
I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going.
I'm just leaving.
But where?
I have to return some videotapes.
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
Good coloring.
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
Nice.
How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
No.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
No, he doesn't.
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
There was no ad in the Times.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
Yes, naturally.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
The message you left.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
It's just not.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
No, you...didn't?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Lucky, I guess.
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
Uh huh.
It looks so soft.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Commes des Garcon.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Where are you going?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Patrick?
What? CARRUTHERS  I'll call you.
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
Oh, who knows? They don't know that. Prove it.
Maybe it's just the light.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
What?
It's a fucking milligram of Sweet'n Low!
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
I guess you're right...  THAT IS, IF THE FAGGOT IN THE NEXT STALL THINKS IT'S OKAY!
Like what?
Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
New card. What do you think?
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Ask me a question.
Leaving what?
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
Oh really? That's great.
I said we are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
See you then.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
When?
After six.
Negative. Cancel it.
Just...say...no.
Just say no?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
I'll do it.
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Who?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Yes, Patrick?
Would you like to accompany me to dinner?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Dorsia is...fine.
You didn't give them a name.
They know me.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
No, not really.
Interesting.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Growing. I'm glad you said that.
Who's Ted Bundy?
What's that?
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
Sorry.
Jean? What?
Hmmmm.
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
Jean-I'm not-
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What are I doing?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Why?
Just...say...no!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
What do you think I do?
A model? An actor?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well...
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
No. I really don't.
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Hello
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Next Saturday?
Yeah.
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin�e of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
Okay. Do.
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
Uh huh?
She's from...France.
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Don't tell him you're here.
Why would I?
Who?
Paul Owen.
I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
No.
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Does he do this all the time?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Coffee?
No. I'm okay.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No, I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Oh no, I'm okay.
It's no problem
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Understandable.  Lime?
No, really. I'm okay.
You sure? I can always get you a lime.
Shoot.
How old are you?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Nice. Very nice.
Thanks.
Who do you ask?
You seem...nervous.
I know. I'm sorry.
No, I guess it's okay.
You sure?
No problem.
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Yale thing?
What do you mean...Yale thing?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
Where did Paul hang out?
Hang...out?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
He had a yacht?
No, he just hung out there.
And where did he go to school?
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
We were both seven in 1969.
So was I.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
Well, maybe he did, huh?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
But...has anyone seen him in London?
Actually, yes.
Hmmm.
Oh.
What?
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
That's so typical, isn't it?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Nothing.
People just...disappear.
The earth just opens up and swallows people.
Eerie. Really eerie.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Not really.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
That's not the information I've received.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Let's see...  That you were with-
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
Not a big music fan, eh?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
Not in the mood, I guess.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Suit yourself, I guess.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
And?
Marcus?
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
But Marcus denied it?
Yes.
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Yes.
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
Where was Marcus?
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
So who was he with?
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and �  - you.
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I lost my job...
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
I'm so hungry.
I'm not...
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
I'm hungry
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
I'm hungry.
Listen, what's your name?
Al.
Speak up. Come on.
Al.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
I've been great. And you?
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Oh well, you know.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Cecelia is, well...you know
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Another Martini, Paul?
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Yes, Owen?
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
No, Owen.
Yes, it is.
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
They still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mind-altering drugs.
You are a fanatic.
'Gonna wait outside.
"Make" him?
You know what I mean.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
You don't wanna move, do you?
I can paint anywhere.
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
...But?
Didn't you visit the campus?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
No way. You have this -- destiny.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
You saved my life in alot of ways.
We're not gonna let it.
Milo! What about --?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Isn't that -- extreme?
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
Teddy was killed last night.
What're you -- what?
It was a hate crime.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You think I don't know that?
Milo. Why would he --
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
I can't just walk away!
You can't just walk in, either.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
...Whaddo I do?
So you believe me?
Nothing.
Nothing?
...Why?
Remember Lyle Barton?
I remember.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
Guilt?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
...Different?
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
What?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Milo --
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
Just shut up?
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
...What?
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Don't we have any chopsticks?
Oh, right. Hold on.
Great.
It's gonna get cold.
Right. Wait. A toast.
You're just afraid to eat it.
No.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
He'll tell me when he gets home.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Prick.
He wasn't acting?
I don't think he knows how.
Right... What's that mean again?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
Have a seat.
I am. I am, sir.
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
My goodness.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
Yes sir.
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
Brian! You wanna be a big deal, don't you? That's your dream in life.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
What'd they ever do for you?
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
What?!
Wanna be a part of history?
Gimme the coordinates?
Is it your dish?
He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
Outpost doesn't own em.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
We tried!
You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
Oh hi.
He's pretty tight with his family.
We could move 'em up here.
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Oh. No thanks.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Low enough to relay internet traffic.
Skywire.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
I do!
Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
Okay. I'm Gary.
...Do I?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
You're making me young again.
Well -- you sent for me.
Right... Right.
What're you implying.
Nothing!
I'm sure.
The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
Definitely.
Were the flags for Teddy?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Talk about work? Never!
I meant did you find other stuff to --
Oh. Yeah.
You've been coming in early.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
The wrong place?
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
You look a little tired.
I'm okay. It's going well!
'Have a look?
Sure.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
What would you tell the kids? At your new school? You had to come up with a good story, right?
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
'Sorry about the late notice...
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
You see what's hanging on the wall?
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Maybe we should all get on it.
There may be a little less trust after your outburst.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Just do what I'm asking!
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Let's go.
Longitude 109 --
Wait... He knows.
What?
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Gary?
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
You do?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Just thought his work should go on.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Those really weird, short lines.
We'll come up with the next big thing.
...You wanna work -- here?
Got out of my other commitment.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Not yet. 'Love to bust my ass cause I'm not in frigging Mensa.  I swear to God, it's that kid Milo, I told 'em so in the first place, but they didn't even wanna hear about it.  Let's run a printout on card entries.
Keep looking.
What're we looking for?
Any irregularity in the pattern.
Let's get him in here.
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
I'm calling Gary.
Where we going?
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
You know my name.
You're famous around here.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
...Were you?
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Show me.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
No. Please.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
You're compulsive.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why's that?
Long story. Not that interesting.
Then and now.  But not right now.
She saved my life.
Why would you do a thing like --
The Day Care?
But why would they --?
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
Oh yeah?
They'd frame him.
He's out of prison?
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
Hmm?
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Certainly not at my happy home.
What about "60 Minutes."
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this --  mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
You mean -- break in?
I don't know --
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
Oh.  I liked you. I was checking you out.
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
What'd he say?
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
Gary.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Thank God.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Why?!
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Please don't go.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
It's three years old, it --
But you said the other --
Let's try #2.
What?
He's been altering the coordinates since we logged on. He's a step ahead. Let's jump to #12.
Wait a second. He knows I know.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Is that how Larry feels?
Uh. Not exactly.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
What?!
Jesus, Teddy.
I met this girl.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
Did you tell Alice?
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
What d'you mean?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
What does that mean?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
I didn't plan this.
Oh we're not going to the campus.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
She's a programmer?
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Right. That's rare around here. You know how nuns' re-married to Jesus? 'Posties are married to Outpost.
#21. Way behind schedule. It's top- secret, but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space. They see the dishes on top, the fiber optics going in.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
Yeah, yeah.
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
You don't look anything like a three- year-old.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
I could get it out of him.
You're not listening.
Where is he?
We're too late. Take a look.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Behave!
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Or sometimes not at all.
Care for some saki?
Sak-i it to me!
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
To my health.
Kiss me.
Is it about my teeth?
Yes.
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Hey, how are you?
Hungry.
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Smashing!
We know all that, Exposition.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Good luck, Austin.
Thank you.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Thank you.  Let's go, baby!
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
We won, Austin.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
Thanks.
Thank you, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
Right away, Exposition.
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Thank you, Basil.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
There's one more thing, Austin.
Yes?
Be careful.
Thank you.
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
What's the other?
Excuse me?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Carnies.
What?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
That's not your mother, that's a man!
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Yes, Basil?
Be careful.
Thanks.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Yes Basil?
Be careful!
Hey, Mick!
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Well, you can't always get what you want.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Good on ya, man.
Groovy!
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
That does not compute.
Love is... love is... love is...
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
Man, you are one chilly square!
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
My mother's told me all about you.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
That's fascinating, Vanessa. Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
Excuse me?
My wedding tackle.
I'm sorry?
My meat and two veg.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
A Chigro?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
Sure.
What?
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
I'm sure.
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
Here, use mine.
I'm going to use a cover name. It's important that it be a generic name so that we don't draw attention to ourselves.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
Do you want to talk to him?
Why?
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
Let me see.
How do you know?
I never forget a pussy... cat.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
I don't get it.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I couldn't have another bite.
I'm sorry.
Why?
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
I am not.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Of course, luv.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
No, did you use a condom?
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Not in the Nineties.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Who?
You know who.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
Indeed.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Yes.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Shut up.
Fair enough.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
I'll hurry back.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
Austin, what's your point?
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Oh, behave!
Likewise.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
Are you crazy?
Don't worry!
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
I'll secure the perimeter.
I love you, Austin.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Kiss me.
Behave!
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
Danger's my middle name.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
That's not mine.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
One book: Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby, by Austin Powers.
Sure.
Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
Where did you learn to shoot?
Is it one of ours?
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
What are you saying, son?
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Shut up.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
What's its current position?
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
Silence!
Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Right. Okay. Moving on.
You shot me right in the arm!  Why did--
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
My son?
Yes.  Scott!
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
Dr. Evil?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
Sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? I hate you!
Not me.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
An evil petting zoo?
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
Yeah. What?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
In due time.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
I don't want to.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Blow me.
Show me.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Scott, don't say that...
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
People have to tell me these things. I've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.  OK, no problem. Here's my second plan. Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser."  Using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer." Slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. That is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.
Right.  Oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. Let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.  Gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway Russian Republic called Kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the United Nations in a few days. Here's the plan. We get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...  ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!
All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
Great.
How's Austin?
You didn't...
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Why?
Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
What about his teeth?
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
I just don't see it.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Did you ever...
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Did you ever want to?
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
I love you, Vanessa.
Well, it's kind of weird.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
And how do you feel about that?
I don't wanna take over the family business.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
No, he's really evil.
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Really?
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
There are limits?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
No need. I'll call again.

Peter ...
Three days.
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
You don't get rain like you used to in England. A good shower that's the ticket. Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Have we met?
You mean you don't recall??
Promised? Who promised?
There, look!
Sir August...?  What now?
Mr. John Steed, please.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
As you see.
Then you can't come in.
I have an appointment.
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Eh? In here!
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
We have met ...
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
People, too.
Then who wins?
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
Hmmm ...
Looks like rain, Steed...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Ropes?
He tried to warn us ...
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
After the cold war ...
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
To you ... ?
The Institute ... the funding ...
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
To find out who killed my husband.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Next assignment?
Thank you, Steed.
Thanks, Valentine ...
An unholy trinity ...
You killed my husband.
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Too many cooks --
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
But -- why?
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
'Our revels now are ended.'
Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
I'm already married ...
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
Valentine, listen to me ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Ring?
You're mad.
Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
The result would be ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
Then what's stopping you?
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
What are my choices?
Choices?
I'll never marry you.
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
1922. Why the kippers?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Whereas you are.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Much better.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
I didn't. Mother did.
Mother?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
Really?  I fail to see the connection.
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Or half cocked.
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
Do you really think so?
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
And I suppose you're the knight.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
As per mother's instructions.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
No thanks.
I meant me.
An eccentric recluse?
June, July ... August?
Any other vices?
All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
Small talk.  Try the weather.
Strange.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
I wasn't about to.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
I might say the same.
Why should they think that?
Frankly that's how I remember it.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this.
Did you say formal? I must dress.
You mean my other self ...
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
How on earth can you tell?
Very good, Steed ...
Any ideas?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Is that written in his shoe?
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Is there anything that isn't?
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Barely.
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Was I?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
To kill me?
Nothing personal.
No trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
It wasn't me; you have my word.
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
Is that all?
Not for a moment.
You're playing games.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I thought you played by the rules.
I thought you didn't.
I'm playing to win.
Winning isn't everything.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
You don't trust me?
As far as you trust me.
You lied.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
No idea who. No idea why ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
You'll find out.
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
You didn't tell her?
Have we been invited?
It's called Black Leather.
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
You first.
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Have a look at this.
Where are you going?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
But --
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Still a bit chilly ...
As a matter of fact I have ...
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Not quite.
Pity your mother came, too ...
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
You're saying I have no choice.
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
Decontamination -- ?
And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive.  He tells me you're very beautiful.
I see.
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Peter's brother?  But --
Half-brother to be precise.
I know all this.
Surveillance? By whom?
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Who's now vanished.
Makes two of us.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
Getting to what?
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
... and now?
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
I shall need a small plane.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Global warming?
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
So you say ...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Dead, I'm afraid.
How did you guess?
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody.  I expect you'll like her.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Possibly. Split personality ...
Insane ... ?
Why?
She may try to kill you.
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Anyone particular in mind?
You.
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
Impossible.
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
Guilty until proven innocent?
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
In your operation.
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
I think so, thank you so much ...
I feel sure of it.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
She was ...
Both, actually.
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
You don't say.  Like looking for a needle in a ...
This way ...
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Stay by the window. By the window.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
The last one you'll ever see.
Perish the thought.
I was at Harrow ...
But did they teach you this?
You wish.
That's not playing by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
If you say so.
I do.
Did I? My mistake.
You are, and it's behind you.
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
Ugh ...
Debbie's marrying Rick.
...Really?
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
What do you mean?
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Yeah. What is it?
You're kidding.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
Women!
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Bond... James Bond.
I want Debbie.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.
Not interested.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I'm marrying Debbie.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
What is this person's story here?
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
The best.
I love that car.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
So does Debbie.
Maybe it had something to do.
Shit!
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
She's mine!
Fan out and look for them.
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes I did.
Fine. How's everything going?
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Sure have...
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Yes, sir, I am.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
I've tried to change her mind.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
But how can I do that?
If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
Keep me informed.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
1002.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
I'm going now, Cole.
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
But a fabulous cook.
What are we having?
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
I think your dinner's burning.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
It looks awful.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Are you going to have women at your party?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
I can't sleep.
Oh... I got something for that.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
About what?
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
C'mere.
Good...
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
You better not have too much joy.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Gonna get married...
Can't I just go with you guys?
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
You're really pissing me off.
Your mother's not dead.
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
I love you.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Why don't you get undressed.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I am committed. I love you.
Yes...
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Let's get naked.
You're on.
Yeah.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
You're so romantic...
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Ilene, Rick promised...
Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Great, Mom.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
Quiet, Mother.
I hope those guys are all right.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
A real turd.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
Let's see your bread.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Screw you!
What are you...
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Why?
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
That's more like it.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Screw you...
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Let's have a toast.
What's going on?
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Screw that.
Yes.
I didn't know you were into that.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
I want women.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I'll take some.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
That's it.
Good.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Right.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
What do you mean, it changes?
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
I just want to be alone.
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah, I guess so.
Really?
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Ha, ha, ha.
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
It's Bullwinkle.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
All right, who serves?
Can't I just maim it a little?
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
I'd love that.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Rick!
Oh, no!
No sob story is going to change my mind.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
You can tell a man by his friends.
The phone made me do it!
You've been having strange sex...!
No, Brett, I...
It's all right...  So have I.
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
Of course.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Olivier's in that, right?
Then it's on to the real thing.
This isn't right.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
I'm not really hungry.
C'mon. I insist.
My gift to you.
Under the table!
The best table in the house.
So long, Father.
About what?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Oooooo.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
That's the old Rick!
I'm proud of you, lad.
I don't know.
What's this?
Got me.
Still drawing a blank.
Very.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Take care.
Who's your friend?
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
I'll stop him... You stall him.
I'm saved. Let's party!
Who?
Debbie.
My Debbie?
What's with her costume?
You got it.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Be gentle.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
No.  I need a drink.
Yeah...
Kind of an asshole, wasn't he?
We're gonna be okay, man...
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
Goddamn it Adcox! Just do your fucking job!
They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
That was an accident! Jesus Christ, why did you have to go in there so fucking early? Why didn't you listen to me!
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
So you're going to fight fires now, huh?
Well, see you're wrong already. Had a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. So starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. My company.  One case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, Brian...
It's comin' along... want a beer?
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
It works.
It worked when you were in sixth grade.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah? What about Laura --
That was never proved.
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Hey! You don't know me --
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
Thanks for the speakers.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Hey.
C'mon, let's crawl home.
This?
Yeah... too bright...
What, are you kidding? By myself?
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
Thanks for the insight.
Brian, look --
Just leave me alone, okay?
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Fuck you.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
So hello.
You're selling dad's boat?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
Saw what?
When dad died, I saw another fire...
Everybody did.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
-- What are you doing here?
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
I know.
How do you know?
-- What were they doing there?
What are we going to do about this?
I'll handle it.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
Shut up!
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Jennifer.
You're back.
You look great.
Thanks for calling.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Huh.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
I work for city hall.
Really? No kidding.
What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
When I was twenty.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
-- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
How's it going?
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
I don't know, I'm kinda swamped here.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
You think that's really any of your business?
Well, you did invite me here.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
Homey.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Then why did you quit?
I wanted to be a good one.
Uh huh.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
I was doing my job.
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Leave Stephen out of this --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
-- I work for the city.
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Hi.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
I don't know anything about it.
Yes.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
Just take it.
That's a dumb thing to say.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
What'll you do?
I don't have the slightest idea...
I'll see ya around, huh?
It's a small town.
Hey, do I know you?
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Who's doing this?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Then who --
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
I don't have a story.
Sure you do.
What?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
The outlets.
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
Trychticholorate.
Good. -- So our two heroes, Adcox and McCaffrey, they go back inside. Only there's another fire in there nobody sees. And it took your dad, didn't it Brian? Did you see him burn?
After it took your dad... the fire... did it look at you Brian? Did it talk to you?...
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
I need another one, sir.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
What are you listening to?
Glass?
Do we have a language barrier here? Glass.
-- Another backdraft.
No it couldn't.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
"During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
And the putty around the door?
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
But the right guess on this is arson.
I don't guess.
I don't work for them, either.
What?
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.
But he killed these guys.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Are you going public with this?
No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
Fire.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
Nice bunch of guys.
Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
Yeah? Airtight?
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Then who wrote the report?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
How ya feeling?
Yeah.
Did I say thanks?
No.
Just wondering.
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Yeah.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Like it never happened...
You look like... Brian.
Four months.
Four months?
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
No need to be modest, Brian.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
I have a job.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
It isn't mine.  Let's get a picture.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Engine 115, right?
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
Backdraft.
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
Swayzak's not my boss.
It's in my blood, Willy.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Management were pin heads.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Coffee sucked.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
I was ahead of my time.
You know, I've got a perfect little spot here for "Brian McCaffrey, Fireman"...
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
And DIE!
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Firehouse.
Cute.
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
I'm busy.
He just wants to --
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Here we go...
Fixing my roof.
It's not your roof anymore.
He's got piano lessons.
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
He's going to be a fireman.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
-- You remember.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
The great communicator.
Sorry I hit Jackson.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
He treats you okay?
Okay.
I treated you better.
You treated me like shit.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
He's out.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
Yeah? When was the last time?
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
You can't keep being his father...
What's wrong?
I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
There's something else kinda interesting...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
That's your job.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
Didn't think you'd make it.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
Who's this?
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You like everybody, Ronald.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Did he tell you how we finally met?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
And old ladies?
-- Burn them.
And the world -- the whole world.
-- Burn it all.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
The glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
What do you listen to, Stephen?
You don't know... nobody knows...
I might.
I need that report, Lt.
Investigator Rimgale.
I need to get in the trunk.
Alderman.
Don't you have any leads at all?
No Marty, I don't.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Investigator...
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
It's nothing. This is New York, man...  Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
What's to believe?
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Yeah.
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Why?
Who?
Yeah.
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
Nah...
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
You mean you could use it.
"The Strawberries"?
The Mets. So anyway, chalk up another 180 G for the Game. Jesus Christ! That's almost half a million dollars. Ariane! Wait. That's not good enough, I'll ask the shithead for 280 G for the kids. Then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. Yeah. Perfect. 280 G for the kids. Yeah, it's good I prepared, or I wouldn't have thought to --
I'm a Catholic.
Yes.
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
Yes.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
That's no mystery. Julio and Paolo brought it in,  You don't want to hurt those boys, do you? I mean, they sure as Hell have got something coming, but it ain't what the Law wants to give them. You understand?  No. How could you understand.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
Me?
I forgive you.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
Please. Please don't forgive me. I've always hated you for that.
I forgive you.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
I forgive you.
All right, cop. I want my money.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Let me think about it.
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
OK, cop. I want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. Tell them I've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. I'll double the Church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 G cash. Get it?
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
All right. What are you gonna do?
I want 15 on the Mets.
How about 7 1/2?
Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm sure.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
What money?
This psycho can.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
What case?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
That 50 G could help you --
You've really got a problem.
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
Yes, Sister?
Yesterday morning, God gave me but one chance to use something else to serve Him. Not my arms or my legs, but something I used for the first time, for the last time, and will never use again. My vagina.
You knew them?  Who were they, Sister? Who are these boys? What are the names of these -- good boys you knew?
How 'bout...
B-L-A-K it is.
I'm on it.
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
1/16, tru' 'dat.  True 'dat.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
Ho!
That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
Yeah!
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
YEAH!
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Let's go NIGGERS.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Give me some?
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
Who are you revolting against?
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Please.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
Delacroix.
Yeah, him.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a show.  Look at all that other junk that's on TV.  We got underground cult following.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
That's mighty black of you.
What's your name?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
We gonna drop some knowledge, wisdom and understanding.  The Mau- Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop science.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout.
What do I do?
What do you do?
I'm a revolutionary.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Why are you smiling so?
Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That hottie Sloan Hopkins.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
She's also moorish.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Seconds and thirds, too.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
You ain't happy about the green light?
Must be the pressure.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
Look at my lips.
What are you talkin' about?
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Meaning?
I'm out.
Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
So that's what you been doing?
Damn skippy.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
No offense.
Manray needs a job.
How much?
First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
Different.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
And this is Manray.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
That can be done.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Did we get our bill yet?
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
And I'm the feet.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
I'm tired of waiting.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We was coming to see you.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
We're starving.
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Well do something about it.
EUREKA!!
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Where do I sign?
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
To what?
You're now Mantan.
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
Why?
You have to start getting into your character.
Mantan!!
How you sound?
I won't do it anymore.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
No costume.  No blackface.
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
But the line has to be drawn.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I'm telling you it's not.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
I've never been given a fair shot.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
I'm wid it.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Go on.  Good so far.
I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
The name of the show?
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back.
What are there character traits?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Exactly!
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
Who are the other characters?
Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
We think so.
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
Dunwitty, don't leave.
Calm down, please.
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
This has to be a big mistake.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
I want to speak with you.
Go away, unless you got my money.
It's me, Peerless.
It's been a long time.
Pleased to meet you.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Where do you go from here?
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I didn't mean that, in life.
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you.  You never gave me no trouble.
Always keep 'em laughing.
Is that so?
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
So what's up with you?
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
Nobody told me anything.
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Manray!
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
Do you know how you will use him?
Not yet, but this thing will never get made.
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
What point is that?
Sounds risky to me.
You getting cold feet?
I'm in till the end.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
And lose out on my money?  The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
This is Cheeba.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
Hello.
Which one is your brother?
The big one.
Break a leg.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
We both lied to him.
What do you want me to say?
Just don't lie to me.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
Everybody shut up.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
A gift.
For what?
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Thanks.
Is that good or bad?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
How so?
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
I don't want to hear it.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
He's just playing big brother.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Do you have to be so damn forthright?
Light?
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
That's why it will be so much fun.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
Work related or otherwise?
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
And that's how you got me in the first place.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
Give me the gun.
He, I'm Mona.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You feel good, not nervous?
I feel fine.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
You sound like the media.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
Same thing Giuliani said.
Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
No.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
Yeah.
And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
What you did is dead wrong.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I don't believe it.
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
It looks delicious.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
That's wonderful.  Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
I'll be right over.
He said that?
Yes he did.
Where is he?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
I can't go all the way down south.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
Regardless, he still is your father.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
No.
Not at all?
You know how your Daddy is.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Soon.
I just turned twenty.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Finland.
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
What's a Negro.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
Thank you for correcting my ignorance.  I'm looking forward to working side by side with you.  I feel we make a good team.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
This is a travesty.  A debacle.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
The best defense is offense.
We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
Thank you.  And always smile.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
You've never had any formal training, either?
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
You sing and dance?
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
So what's up with you and DeLa?
What do you mean?
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS.
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
...the big apple, New York, New York.
To come back to our roots.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
You tellin' the truth.
Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
The one with da big...
Not her, the one with the little...
Oh her.
She hates dem.
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
I thought you got rid of...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
We should go out on a double date.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...no, she didn't...
...yes she did.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...not that time...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
Around...
...too early...
...then what about...
...too late, maybe around...
...perfect...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
...like macaroni and cheese...
...like grits and butter...
...like fried and chicken...
You slept too near where you got in?
I slept too near where I fell out.
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
How be dat?
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
A song a comin' I feel.
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Enough.
What do you want to know?
The good stuff.
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
What else?
Are you trying to rap to me?
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Just a little something' somethin'.
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
Gots no intention of ending up broke.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
You don't read, do you?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up.  They had no choice.  They were considered 3/5ths of a human being.  Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
We can look out for ourselves.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
Y'know what?
What?
You look beautiful like that.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
You leave something out?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
And?
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Say what, Manray?
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Aw, c'mon.
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Why don't you answer?
I know I won't be your puppet.
You can go now.
I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
Good morning.
Where are you bound for?
That is none of your business.
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
I never was more in earnest.
What is your uncle's name?
O'Grady.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
I have acted as I think fit.
Sir, I'm a British officer.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Neither!
How do you do, sir?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
What is the service, sir?
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
And his baggage?
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Your cousins go out with him.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
I'll match any man with the sword.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
It must have been some other gate.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
Is Miss Dugan well?
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
The coward!
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I have heard of them.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I don't know.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
I will let down the steps for your honor.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Your honor must lower his voice.
All Europe shall hear of this!
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
Yes, sir.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
For whom else have you worked?
Who else can give me information about you?
Only the agency of servants.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
I believe they will deport you.
I have faced that problem before.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
But how, sir?
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Certain?
Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Then you yield to me.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
That is a trifle strong.
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
Have you had one?
Never.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Not even that.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Not one.
Have you not a man whom you value?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
How so?
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
It is my only object.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Old fool!
Agreed.
Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
Then you must get it.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
But you refused me, Dorothy.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
All right, five hundred guineas.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
By name only.
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Hmm-mmmm.
When is he to go?
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
May I be quite frank with you?
Yes, of course.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Papa?
Yes?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Yes, papa.
Yes, he's fine.
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
The milkmaid's daughter?
Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
I beg your pardon?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Dark Valdez.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
He is only curious to know who you are.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
He loves me, as I love you.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
You know that was like a quadruple negative?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
Who?
Old friend. Haven't talked to him in -- 911. Can I use your phone?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
What do we do?
Whoever it is isn't shooting at us...
Fine.
It was the grenade you fucking idiot. Look at him!
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
Can anybody hear me!
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
I don't know!
HEY!
Shut up, Mueller.
We don't know. West is dead.
Shut up.  West's dead.
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
I asked for a policeman.
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
It's... too slow.
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
I just don't like it.
What do you like then?
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
They're dead, aren't they?
Okay.
I'm not telling you what happened.
Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
Tell me about them.
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
No, actually, I just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some.
That son of a bitch.
That'd be my reaction too --
He's lying.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
I'm serious --
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
I didn't shoot West --
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
You saw West's body.
Yeah --
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
You saved Kendall's life --
But not Pike's.
Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this -- I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.
You wanna bet?
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
We've found all of them.
Jesus!
Do what?
And the bodies?
You won't find them. Won't find West, either. He's too good.
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
He's telling the truth up to a point...
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
There were six of us...
Epilepsy.
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
What business?
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
The creek bed --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Yeah.
Would you have believed me?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Can't do that now, though, can you?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
How do you know that?
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
Your weapons, Sergeant.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
Why?
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
West... he's dead.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
I...
West's. Any kindling for afire?
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
Do I?
Yeah...
You hated West more than any of us.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
If not you, then who?
Mueller.
Oh, come on --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
That's exactly what he says about you.
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Bullshit.
Why?
Just look. Little pocket.
You're lying --
Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Full clip to the body --
From up close or far away?
His chest was hamburger --
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
They?
Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
What don't you know?
This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
Put it down!
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
But not the only victim, right?
My, my, my, how did things turn so hostile so quickly? If I didn't know better, I'd say you two were out to get me.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
What happened to "degrees"?
I didn't kill him --
Then who did?
But you didn't.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
Mr. Hardy?
Stop.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
My heart weeps.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
No. I said Dunbar.
Well?
Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
I didn't do anything --
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Because I was standing next to him.
I didn't --
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
I don't know --
Where are they!
Maybe --
MAYBE WHAT --
Maybe he...
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
What kind of trouble are you in?
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
Tell me what I can do.
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
Well, he's a good soldier.
And the problem is you only got three.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Who killed Pike?
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Nevertheless --
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
Not for me.
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
Home, I'm done.
What about the confession?
What the hell are you talking about --
Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
Yeah.
Does Osborne agree?
That's horseshit and you know it.
Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
The Senator...
Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
What are you talking about?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You're drunk --
I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
That's preposterous --
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
I wanted to see if he was okay --
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
You're crazy --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Get your hands away from the desk!
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
You knew Sergeant West?
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
You and the Colonel go back.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
He's in interrogation?
Yes.
Move him.
Why?
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Excuse me?
Is Dunbar cute?
That is the most unprofessional --
Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
Good cop/bad cop?
Something like that.
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You made me look like an idiot --
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
Something like that. You?
I lost a bet.
The very same.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
You're off to a late start.
So noted.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
What point?
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
Not the happiest of memories?
Got it.
I lied. Wait for it...
I don't think that has anything to do with --
That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Watch me.
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
But you will.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
What happened next?
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
Dunbar.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
Buttfucks the cabin?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
That bugs you too?
Little bit.
Let's go talk to Bill...
They got their stories straight.
What?
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
Are you sure?
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Good idea.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
You couldn't have known --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
You mean the falsely accused?
Yeah.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
Nah.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
For what?
That's gonna stay my secret.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
No.
Good, just making sure.
Isn't this how your story goes?
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
No death certificates. No crime.
Seven.
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
What if I don't want it?
Tough.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
You're a good man, Hardy.
Really.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
Want company?
I should probably write that down.
Yeah.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
What are you talking about?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
I don't think I want to hear this --
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
The faggot speaks.
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
Poor fucker my ass...
You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
Oh, you remember now --
I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
So you took off your shirt?
He wanted more than that.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
No one else heard it?
But you didn't see it, right?
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
We've been making progress, I see.
Fifty minutes.
Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it?
No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
You can't threaten me --
Wait --
What.
Wrong answer --
We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
Childs.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
What the fuck are you doing?
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
I used it to start the fire --
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
We're not going anywhere.
The fuck are you talking about --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
Bullshit --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
You mean Ray Dunbar? Well, that ain't right.
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He's not Army, it's not official --
Then it's unofficial.
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
No --
It's too neat.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
We know.
I'm giving you a chance to walk away.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
Sir, yes, sir!
LZ is two clicks North of a cabin, you are to split into teams of two and work your way through your designated area blasting as many targets as you can find! Each area has twenty targets, first team to take all twenty and find the cabin wins! Teams are as follows -- Dunbar and Nunez, Pike and Mueller, Kendall and Childs!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
That's great.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Yes!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
I'll work night and day, and you won't have to pay me. You just have to tell me who she is.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
That would explain the indigestion.
There's only one I want.
Thank you.
Good luck, kid.
Edward Bloom.
Yes.
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
Not yet.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
It truly is.
Why?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
No one's ever left.
I don't expect to.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Then do it.
Fine, I will.
Fine, you do it.
Fine, I'm doing it.
I brought it.
Don.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
A pleasure.
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
No.
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
Well, she... uh...
Was she nekkid?
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
Eighteen.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
So I've heard.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I see. I thank you for your time.
I can get it. I can just...
Please. Go. Just go.
Go.
I know.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Lucky girl.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
What were you dreaming about?
That's terrible.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
No, I understand.
He was slipping her a little extra cream.
Stop.
They were squeezing the cheese. Clanking the bottles. Licking the popsicle.
Can I take your picture?
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
Please?
I never knew.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Well, it's not a short one.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
You were talking about your wedding.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
I like your stories.
And I like you.
I can.
So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
What's your name, Giant?
Karl.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
You don't like it?
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Okay.
Beats me.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Make him stop.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Friend of yours? Did you help him out of a bind?
No Dad, they don't. I do not like the story. Not anymore, not after a thousand times. I know all the punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as well as you can.  For one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around Edward Bloom. It revolves around me and my wife. How can you not understand that?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
I'm not scared.
Did you do any of that?
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
You think I'm up for it?
You learned from the best.
Really.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
She was a witch.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
So how does it happen?
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
Okay.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
What did he say?
You owe me three-fifty.
Really.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You're right.
You mean, while I'm here.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
I will.
You know where the chemicals are?
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Oh, so you know.
Yes.
I think someone hasn't.
Dad?
Son?
Can we talk?
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
You think I'm fake.
Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
It would kill you, huh?
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
The river?
How what happens?
How I go.
Okay. Okay.
You say...
The River!
Story of my life.
Yes. Exactly.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
They're your favorite flower.
How did you get so many?
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
Go out with me.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Really.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
I'm robbing this place.
'Fraid so.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
Hello.
I wasn't expecting you.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
Because he's dying.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
You didn't become crazy.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
Yes.
Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
I'll help you.
I need to lie down for a bit.
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
I do.
I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You need to go.
Probably tonight.
I'm going with you.
Did you?
They met at Auburn.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
That's because most of it never happened.
But it's romantic.
Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
Do you love him?
But it's not true.
What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
You're not.
I need you on my side.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
Is he going to be okay?
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
We rented a car.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
He's up with your father.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
How much time does he have left?
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Really! That's wonderful.
Of course.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Yes.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes. But that's a different...
No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
True. But I've known him my whole life, and I don't feel like I know him at all. Or ever will.
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Do you know who that is?
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Yes?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
That's okay?
Yes. Thank you.
You know what for.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
Such as?
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
I paid for those guitar cases.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were good.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
There's over eighty thousand here.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Yes.
We'll stop then.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.
It is. I did it cooking.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Name it.
What are you doing here?
Leave him!
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
No I haven't.
Ch...
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
You can see why it's sensitive?
Uh... Yes.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
Right.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
What are you doing here?
I'm asking what you're here for.
What?
He says he feels safe here.
Oh.  We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
Good.
And...
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Right.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Right.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
You must have a visa or something...
You're asking for my documents?
No, no...
Uh. Do you like England?
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
What?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
I...
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
Oh nothing.
Tell me.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me what he said.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
Do you believe in love?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
You can stay tonight.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Good night.
John.
Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
What? What does he want?
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants money.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
I'm so sorry.
Leave her alone.
Yes.
Right. Okay. Good.
Yes.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Yes.
Happy bath day.
Syevodnya
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
Yes I know.
What's wrong?
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
They go.
You don't understand anything.
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
I don't want to know.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Well as it turns out I did.
No I don't.
I know you just want to punish me --
So you're just going to be vindictive
In every sense. If at all possible.
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
What?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
What? No you're not..
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Yes.
I don't have any money.
I said I don't have any.
I don't want to talk about him.
Fine.
It's none of your business.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
Oh Jesus.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
But, you know, so what?
He will come back.
Excuse me?
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
You don't want to talk about it.
No.
Okay we won't talk about it.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
I don't hate you.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
And? What are you saying?
And. It's wrong.
And who says what is wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
Sometimes.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes neither.
Some... What does that mean?
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
So now you hate all women?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You...
I got what I paid for.
You didn't mind too much.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand me.
You don't understand you either.
Get out
You are throwing me out.
Get out.
You don't have to say anything
What? I... I wasn't saying...
Please, there's no... Oh.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
I don't have nothing.
Well what have you got?
No.
Have you had any before?
No.
Not really. Maybe a little.
What?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
She's dead.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
She's alive?
I'm trying to quit.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I don't want anyone to die.
Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
What was her name?
What's your name?
Okay. Thank you.
Whatever.
Please. Why not?
Because it was a lie.
Goodbye.
Okay. Promise?
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
Please.
It's not mine either.
It's what you came back for.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
No. What? No. I know.
It's more like a date.
It's a long way to go for a date.
Tell me about it.
Maybe you will find out.
Right.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Thanks.
How do you want to pay?
Cash.
Just wanted to see.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Yeah, I know.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh! Gave me a start.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
You hurt it?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
Well. It's good to see you.
Yes?
I need to uh...
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
You take her to a doctor?
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
Oh, she older than that.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Not if no one finds out.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
You didn't have to do this.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
You liked what I brung ya?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
That'd be nice.
At church?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
You gonna sing me somethin'?
When? Now? Oh. No.
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
What do you need?
I need ya help again.
Can I come in?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
I do. God's truth. I do.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
Hey.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
No, ma'am.
Okay.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Well, that makes it easier.
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
For your hands?
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
I'll take a jar of that, too.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
You gonna miss your bus.
Yeah.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Sure.
Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
She's around. Always is.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
You been home yet?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
You need a ride?
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
That's not right, really, cuz I...
You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
Now wait...
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
You go to hell.
Stop what?
I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
Yeah.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
And you gonna live it with him?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Kept us warm for twelve years.
Better'n me?
Rose... please...
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
I don't love ya no more.
Let go...
Let go of my arm...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
LAZ, I said let...!
You better pray, gal. You better pray...
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Or what? OR WHAT?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You sayin' you'll do what?
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
How long... how long I been out?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Two days?
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Well I don't...
Wait. He left.
Don't need none.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
Why you got me chained?
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
The fuck you been doin' to me?
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
How you let men treat ya like they do?
What?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
No ma'am.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
In my house, you watch that lip...
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Or what?
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
I CAN'T!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
If I break one you gonna shoot me?
Uh-uh.
Itches.
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Uh-uh.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Let go of me...
GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
Uh-uh.
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
I don't fuckin' cook.
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
I can handle that.
Well, get to it.
You drink whiskey?
Sure.
We drinkin' buddies now?
To freedom.
No joke.
I ain't in a hurry.
Anything.
I'm here with you.
I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am I gonna put all this love?
The... chain helps.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
Nothin'.
By myself?
You can handle it.
Yeah, gal I been here before.
I guess you have.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Looks like you know a song.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
I know that.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
What I love.
Get a good picture in your mind.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Maybe I won't.
Word wit'cha. In private.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Huh?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
This Rae... you get with her?
Why you say that?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Now, hold up.
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
What'chu sayin'?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Uh-huh.
He tapped that.
Naw!
Go ask him.
Meanin' like a team of fellas go to work on her and she don't even break a sweat.  She into football, you know. You got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap. I ain't playin'.
Like I told you.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
I didn't start this, R.L.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Why's his britches round his knees?
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
You sayin' that gun's for me if I don't?
Ain't gonna be moved?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Or what?
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
One thing at a time, Laz.
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
This all looks wonderful.
Ask the chef.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Not like that.
Then what?
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
I do.
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Yes'sir.
Why she got a chain on her?
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
Please don't tell my daddy.
My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
Yes'sir.
You struck some gold, didn't ya?
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
That's right.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
You could put it that way.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
What's on your mind?
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Rae...
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Rae don't do this now...
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Rae!
Hey.
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
You feelin' sick?
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah?
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
Are you wasted?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Holy shit!
What?
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
I'm a what?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh?
Ronnie...
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
Yeah.
You need money again?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
I just wanted some make-up.
All that shit's on aisle 5.
The hell are you talkin' about?
Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
Thought you had a man for that.
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
The hell you call me?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
Thanks.
Home.
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Let go...
Get rid of it.
Why?
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Charlie...
-- I should tear your head off.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
What?
The Wolf?
Maybe we should do something?
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
Not a prayer.
Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York.  You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
Where is the subway station, please.
No.
Number five with a bullet.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
I didn't know.
The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  I was new, didn't know shit.  When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor.  It's on the top of my personnel file.  They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
Hey, when in Rome --
Nick, we can't just --
I said let's go, Charlie.
Let's grab some food.
First decent idea you've had.
You said that in the last two places.
I hope not.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Maybe we should bail?
I don't think he'd feel it.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
What'd she say?
That I should let you pay for the drinks.  Kampai.
Cool?
You all right?  You okay?
What does Charlie mean?
Hey, all right.
Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
Connie...
All right, how's the new partner?
High spirits, desire, commitment.
You'll take care of that.
Give me a break, would you?
If you give me one.
I wasn't expecting you.
Where would you look for the mafia?
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
What's the problem here?
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why the hell not?
I don't, that's all.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
Why weren't you at the platform?
I couldn't keep up.  My shame is complete.
Yeah...
I'll get him for you, Nick.
I can see that.
I stole them.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
A snitch?
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
Nick...
There she is!
Are we getting married?
Sure.
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
Good.  Very good...
You were too far behind.
Gaiijin.
I'll check it out.
You can trust me.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
Nick --
Shut-up.
I want to yank Kobo.
San is an honorable title.
A few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
A resort city, Beppu.
I want to go talk to him.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Big enough.
It's illegal, Nick.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
So I bring some cheese?
Let's go.  Him first.
Nick, you can't do this.
No.
Not now, man, okay, not now.  Work with me.
I can't...
I called Ohashi, he'll be waiting.  I like him waiting.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
How many men?
I couldn't tell.
Joyce?
I don't know.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
A wife.  She left.
Me too.
Luck.
Why's that?
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
Yes...
Call for help.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
We can't lose.
How can you be so sure?
He gets as much as he wants.
There was a change in plans.
Gaiijin?
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
I don't give tours.
You have a helluva way of answering.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
I don't think so.
Sure, but then I just pull out the photos.
He's on duty.
I paid for that.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
Where's Ich?
Unavailable.
I need someone to translate for me.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
And I'm supposed to care?
You could fake it.
He drinks.
He's got a reason.
You met her.
What do you chant?
Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
I don't remember saying yes.
I don't remember you saying no.
Who am I supposed to be?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Tell them I'm not.
The cheese...
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
What if I chant?
Wouldn't help.  Watch out for Ich.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Might be different in New York.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
I'd like that.
I'm taking you back.
Guess I'm on a roll.
She's such a long way home for you.
Time, I've got plenty of.
I'm amused.
Don't be.
This by this...
Dope?
Not in that company.
The old man was a Japanese paper manufacturer.  Hotel room and rental car were full of it.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
Why?
What?
What...?  What if I say no?
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Why me?
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
He was my partner.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
I planned on catching him, Captain.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
He killed a police officer.
Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
Right.
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
It is not allowed.
We're police officers.
You're foreigners.
Work with me.  I want your best detective.
Do you know what this is?
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Look.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
You had my help, detective.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
I have to get to Sugai.
Goodbye, officer.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
I want him.
He'll be dealt with.
The families who control the casinos?
Yes.  Unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... We can't afford not to deal with them.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
You trust me?
I'll pay you.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
If I say no?
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
You want him dead too.
After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
We were worried to death.  It's awfully kind of you.
You certainly have a nice place here.
Well stocked.
If he won't cooperate?
Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Pris?
Where?
Not to be trapped.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
Then go get him.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Would you like to be modified?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
What's the problem?
Death.
I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
Come here.
Why?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
But not to last.
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
I am?
Also extraordinary things.
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Well, actually
You're androids.
Nexus - 6.
Like what?
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Of course not.
You could help us.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
Dr. Tyrell?
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
He could?
His company made us.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
No.
When do you deliver your project?
This afternoon.
Thank you.
Just thought I'd...
No, you stay here with us.  Out last night together.
He's not ready yet.
When?
Hello, glad to meet you.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
What was he after?
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Where do we start?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Industrial refuse.
Garbage man?
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
I was just about to have my dinner.
If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
You didn't like her!?
Yeah.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Yeah.
She's not with you?
Who.
Got it.
Okay, here it is.  Eldon Tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  The cat is about to get out of the bag.  Pressure is definitely on.  The Nexus program is terminated.  When you finish there, locate Nexus designated Rachael and retire.
Yeah.  I got it.
Your customer, eh?
Soon as I finish the job.
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
Why, yes, of course.
You start.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
How do I stop one?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Okay, but...
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
I know all that.
What about a summary then.
Do you have something against science?
Not if it works.
And what in your estimation works?
Longevity is classified.  No.
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Next.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
Number three.
Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
It's okay.  Forget it.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Vodka!
My pleasure.
Prosit.
Sorry, don't have the time.
No problem.
Ya.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Prosit.
I like you too.
One more, eh?
I gotta piss.
I don't know.
Four years.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
Sorry.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Money?
No.  I got a problem.
Let's hear it.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
These aren't just...
I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
No rust?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Meaning?
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
Yeah?
Huh huh.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
True.
Nope.
You're going to be over the limit.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
What if you change your mind?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
You sure?
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Too old.
But if you could?
Yes?
Can I come in?
Of course.
Do you recognize any of them?
What did she want?
Who?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
What night?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
What's suck night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
Are you for real?
What the fuck for?
For holes.
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
It's a good job.
You mean the snake.
Does it eat?
Come on.
Sorry.
Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
I bet I would.
Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
And who do I go to about you?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
Of course not.
Why should I be?
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
I'd kill it.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
I'd never get an abortion.
Why not?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
In your opinion.
It would be my child.
Ugh.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I've already got more help than I need.
I think you need more help than you've got.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
I work alone.
So?
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
Yeah.
Can you?  I couldn't.
Right.
What do you want me to do?
Sit.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
You did?
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
Where is he?
Dead.
Oh.
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
Not too good.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Yeah.
That's another thing I can't do.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
What?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Like?
I'm not sure.  Is there a secret?
Hmmm?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
But then how can you...
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
I never felt better.
You mean a woman?
What's a long time?
Ten years.
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
What difference will it make?
Just wait here.
What?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
What's up?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
I'll see you in a minute.
Black?
Please.
Yes.
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
Go ahead.
But in your profession that is a risk.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Sitting next to you.
If she is, the machine works.
The machine works.  She is.
Thirteen.
Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
Five, maybe six.
Discreetly.
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
Sorry.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
I'm tired of this.
Almost through.
Don't move.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
What one?
What desert?
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
But how come I'd be there?
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
A tortoise.  What's that?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
I never seen a turtle.
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
Pris.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Hi.
Oh.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
We sure did.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Just better.
Beautiful.
Thanks.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
What's that?
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Is that why you're still here?
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
Good.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
You're all so perfect.
Yes?
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
You like it?
Bravo!
Thank-Q!
I'm Adam Webber.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Your mom was a dancer?
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Sure.
How do you do?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Come where?
My office.
For how long?
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Young man, stop right there!
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
Oh, brother...
What?!
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Do ya?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Eve? I'm leaving.
Are you French?
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
No, you get out of here.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
No, I'm lost.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Dickhead?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Oh, that's nice.
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Again.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
It was amazing.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Do you own a car?
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
Get away from me!!
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Yes.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Heck, no!  What?!
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
It's Perry!
Perry?
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Oh, I could die...
Over this?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
I know a short-cut.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Right.
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Okay.
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Okay!  Damn!
No.
Thank-Q!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
I think it's the eyes.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Watching television in color.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Why doesn't it never work out?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Why not go to work for me?
Doing what?
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Sure.
They like Dr. Pepper.
Who are these people?
Very funny, smart ass.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
What?
Sorry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Night!
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
I guess we'll need another locker.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Name it.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Then forget it.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
This is for me.
A wife?
Yes.
What for?
Because I want to get married.
Why?!
I don't want to be alone.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Bites what?
The big one!
Sure.
I didn't know that.
They're all divorced?
Everybody's divorced.
It didn't used to be that way.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
One who's not a mutant.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
That's what I was afraid of.
Of course.
Thank you.
The engine is still running.
Stop that ma'am crap!
I told you I've never driven before!
Never drive again!
You said it would be easy!
I was wrong!!
Is this your house?
Yes!
I like it.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Thank-Q!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
Um-hum.
Yes!
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Wow.
Good for you.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
He has a computer?
Sure.
In the house?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Uh...yeah.
So, what are you seeing?
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Yeah.
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
I certainly do!
No it's not!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Look unimpressed.
Do I look crazy?
Yes!
Not that one!
I like her.
And don't be so obvious!
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
No way.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
How 'bout this one?
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Did you?
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
I'm sorry.
Eve, I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
I'm really sorry!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What?
Goodnight!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
I know first aid!
Well, you had better!!
Thanks.
Is that what you call it?
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Sing it to me.
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
No.
Yes, Eve?
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
My pleasure.
It was at least as good as the sky.
Really?  Okay!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Neat. Goodnight!
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
...I do.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
My mother's like that.
Yes, it is.
Gee-ma-nee!
What?
Nothing.
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Yes, sir.
Of course!
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Yes.
I've got to go, now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
How do I leave here?
I promise.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Tempus fugit!
Gerade aus dann links!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
What's baseball?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No. Sit down.
Why?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Then why go there?
Because he must!
Blow out the candles!
Your mom made that all by herself.
No kidding!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Shit is a French word?
Merci!
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
I promise. Is that all?
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
I'll try.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
Well, in that case...of course, son.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
You're sure?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes, sir. It's true.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I think they have.
Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Not particularly.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
I love Lucy!
You nut!
And it's called...?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
Really?  Since when?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
She's right?!
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
1959.
Who use to own it?
Russia.
When did we get it from them?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
What's the capitol?
Juneau.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Yeah.
It's so small.
I don't think so.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
No.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
That would knock my father out.
Yeah?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
True.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Okay.
No.
Almost all of them.
The recovery is very impressive.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
I LOVE THIS!!
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Oh. I see.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
You bet!
So, did you buy a movie?
What?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Does that work?
Goodbye.
What?
Of what?
The hotel.
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
My father is a genius.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
How old are you?
Thirty-five.
You don't look thirty-five.
How old do I look?
Twenty-five? Around there.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Up there!!
I don't see anything!
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Gladly.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
How do you do, ma'am.
I do alright.
Good!
Hi.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Well, we're here to help!
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
Yes, ma'am.
Sorry, Mom!
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
Yes, ma'am.
I just hope this is still good up there.
Mom?
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Are you in trouble, son?!
A psychiatrist?!
What?
I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Well, where are you --
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
No.
Yes.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
What about relatives?
All back East.
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
Good god.
Yeah.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Good.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Really?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Well, put it down and come in!
You bet, hon!
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
No.  They all do.
I never know anymore.
Yes.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Days??
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Yes, dear!
As long as we've got that straight.
To you maybe.
The locks.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Thirty -five years!
Then after that it's safe.
It's safe.
To go up.
No.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
All our friends...
I'm not hungry.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Really?
How could you?! This is just like home!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
You have tranquilizers?
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
I've noticed.
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Yes!
If I...you know...
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Why?
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
What?
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Hi.
Coming!
You bet.
And I made these!
If he tells, it won't come true!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Well, we did in my family!
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Would you excuse me?
Sure.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Just open the door.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Yes! That's right!
Mutants?!
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
No.
Yes.
I don't believe it!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We stay down here.
We do?
Yes.
Excuse me.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
Well, I am the head of this household--
I want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
--do as I say!
Yes, dear, I know.
Amen.
I thought ten years.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Some time.
What can I offer you, Eve?
What are you doing here?
I forgot some of my stuff.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I knew you'd like him.
Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Oh, yes.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Oh, my God...
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Well, that's blunt!
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
What do you think, Adam?
I think...it...works.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
No.
He's from Alaska.
Always good advice.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Eve?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Uh..he might of.
We did not leave together.
Who did he leave with?
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
To bed.
To bed?
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
Yes, you do.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Uh, yes, you do.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Yes, you do!
Or have perfect table manners.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
What?
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Where did he get all that information?
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
What?!!
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
You're goddamn right I am!
Coward!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Fallout shelter.
Give it back to him.
And if we can't find him?
We'll find him.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Have him committed.
Yeah! That's thinking.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
I don't know. I like to think so.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
To get some frozen poultry.
Then what?
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
What?!
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Come on.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Where?!
Stop!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
Um...uh...
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Buy it from me?
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Stand by. One.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Yeah. How's Dad?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
I'm not sick.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
I've seen a few.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. Cheers.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yes.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
It must be great.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Yes?
Okay.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Yes.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Why do you do it?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yeah. I get it.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Yeah.
Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Is Sandy part of this?
No, not at all.
Who knows you have these?
You're all through with this now?
Yes sir. I sure am.
Yes sir.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Not yet.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Yeah.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Jeffrey nothing.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I wanted to see you.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Well.
THEN WHAT?
Then you got undressed.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
No. Come on.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
No way.
I, I don't know.
What do you want?
Yes.
No.
Lie down on the bed.
Nothing. Are you alright?
I'll go then.
No.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
It's okay. It's okay.
Yes.
See my breasts? See?
See my nipples?
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
No, please. I won't.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
What?
Do you know?
No.
You don't?
No. What is happening?
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Then don't talk about killing.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Don't say that.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
OK.
Yeah, hurry up though.
I, uh.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Same here.
Frank? Can you stand up?
I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
Falling.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Don? Are you in with them?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
Yes.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
No. I should go.
Please, please stay.
Hello.
Yes. Frank--
Frank is coming?
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
I sure don't hate you.
That's good.
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
Whatiya mean?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Frank would open you.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
Come on Dorothy.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Kiss me.
Do you love me?
I asked first.
Sometimes I think I do.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
Just get outta my bed.
No, it's not Don.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You what?
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I'm glad you do.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Dorothy. No!
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
You called me Jeffrey.
I did. Are you?
Yes.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
No. Not really.  But also because I really want you to be alright.
I want you to stay with me.
I think I better go.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
You look beautiful to me.
No.  Hi baby.
It's okay. It's okay.
My secret lover.
Who, Dorothy?
Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Bull.
He's comin' back? What for?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Hello, daddy.
My bourbon.
Baby wants to fuck.
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Frank?
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Can I feel 'em?
If you want to.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Speak to me Fucker.
No thanks. What does that mean?
I don't want to go.
Go where?
On a ride.
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Here's to Ben.
Do you see, Ben? I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
What?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back.
Nothing.
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?
Yes.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
There ya go.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
Mom.
This is it.
Be right down.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Well. Okay.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Yeah?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
What?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Do you want the car?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Alright.
Yeah, I know.
Would you like a piece of cake?
No. No thank you.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Yeah. okay.
Yeah.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
That sounds great!
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
I'll get a coat for her.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Well.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Hey Jeff.
Uh-uh.
Are you feeling okay?
Uh-uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Good deal Dad.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Am I bothering you?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yes.
How is Central these days?
Terrible boring.
What else is new? Right?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
That's too bad.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
Maybe so.
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I guess you have to get back home soon?
Where are they?
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
I don't know. He moved away.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Yeah. Good bye.
I don't know.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
I'm here, aren't I?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
You've got a point there.
Alright.
Let's go.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yeah.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
Yes. I do.
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Two.
I'll drink to that.
Why not?
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah, but.
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
OK.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Okay, yeah, call.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Yeah.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Are you sure?
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Okay, okay. Bye.
What did you see?
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
You saw a lot in one night.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yes.
Did you see her undressed?
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
Who, me? Why should it?
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Okay, Sandy.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay, okay.
See ya tomorrow.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
You want to go talk to him?
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Shoot.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Oh yeah?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey!!
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey? Why?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You like mysteries that much?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
You didn't tell him about me?
No.
Okay. Great!
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
It's okay.
You look beautiful.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Really?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
NO.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Just a minute.
Okay.
Frank!!!
No.
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Yes.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. No. Why?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Go ahead.
Sandy?
Go ahead!
No Jeffrey!!
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Okay.
Stop it Mike.
You shut up. Nobody's talkin' to you. Hey who's that Jeffrey? Your mother?
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Just for him?
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Up where?
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Oh fuck!
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
I need Il Duce.
This kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. If he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. But it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. And even worse the kid is good at it. I mean I had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
What did you do, Connor?
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
Aye.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
I can't find the second one, sir.
Look under the body.
Got it.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Any word back from the E.R.s?
What?
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Where's your gun?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
This is a six-shooter.
Let's do him right here.
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Yes.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
You sound real remorseful.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
What?
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
You think they sold me out? No way.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
I-I'll tip her.
This place is like a scumbag yard sale.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
C'mon!
I know what the fuck he looks like!
What?  What, that guy?
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
We're here brother.
You gotta keep going.
Connor, is that you?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here.
BLAME...
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Well, I didn't but...
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
We... met them last night.
They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
We paid attention in school.
Know any other languages?
Our mother can see through bags.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Be careful.
I'll call you tonight, afterwards.
An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, he left me this.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
Right.
Fuck!
me up the...
Ass!
Aye.
Aye.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Shut it. It's Ma.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
He got beat up by a girl.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Okay. We're ready.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
Italian.
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
No pictures, either.
...so that which is good may flourish
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
What?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
I'm serious.
I don't know they just always need it.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
A bit.
Me, too.
No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
Aye.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
Oh, we're good man.
Yes, we are.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
Yes.
Then what the fuck?
Holy shit. Who? How many?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
A-fuckin'-men!
And he is one smart man.
He's a good man.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your corrupt we claim.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
Uh... two shooters!
Fan-fuckin-tastic!
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
Can she I.D. them?
They were wearing masks.
Of course they were. How many?
Three.
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
No. This guy is big time.  These two are street-walking scum.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
How do you figure?
Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
Rocco!
Where's my cat?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
You killed my... my...
My, my...
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little...
Pee...Per...Man.
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
It was... It was...
Male or female, bitch?!!
Really want to know?
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
The what man?
The fat man.
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
And the pennies?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
The Greeks. The Italians.
The Sicilians.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
What about one guy with two guns?
Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
What?
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Why was I not informed of this?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
Twist of lemon!
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Sweet-n-low!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
Eight.
Shit! Shit!
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Witness?
No way they could have seen it.
Who were the victims?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
I...
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
We promise.
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
What are you serious?
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Fuck you!
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh?  Fuck you!
I'll be back at 9:00.
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
No. You sure you're okay?
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
This is some crazy shit, man!
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
You sure you killed them?
Y'know it is, a bit.
So?
Well, what'ya do?
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
Well, I'm sold.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
What the fuck do you mean?
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Y-Yes my son.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
What is it my son?
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
God's permission? God doesn't...
You believe?
Yes.
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
I guess not.
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
I believe these young men are right.
You know them personally?
Yes.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
No. They would never do that.
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Forgive me father.
Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
Yes.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Open it!
Have you no fear of God?
God have mercy on my soul.
What do you want me to say?
Just be natural, goddamit.
How long since your last confession, my son?
Just go!
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Yeah boss?
The... The funny man.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
He's a nigger.
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Making Hutch David Soul?
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
What does Starsky say?
He says. This is he.
This is he?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
Would they do that?
Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
She's an attractive older woman.
What do you think the cops have?
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
How was I ridiculing you?
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
Yeah, I saw it.
I'm lookout.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
That sets it off.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
Yeah, I heard that.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Eight dollars.
Just turn right here.
You think we're going to be chased?
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
Nothing. Go ahead.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Dignan! Stop!
You're right. You're right.
Where's the other stocker?
There's another stocker, right?
We know there's another stocker.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
We got it. We got it.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Like he meant it.
Yeah.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
What do you think?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Don't even say it, man.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Why not?
Because my mom gets the bill.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
I don't want to use it.
Well, then cut it in half.
I keep it for emergencies.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Yes, they are.
Look at the treads on those.
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
You were spoiled rotten.
I'll say it.
On your marks...  Get set go.
Bob?
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
True.
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
No. We didn't.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Sure.
What. What's the matter?
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
They don't?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Which one was that?
On the left.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
As long as he gets out OK.
Obviously. That's a given.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
This was in fourth grade.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
Yes... It's true.
Where was it parked?
Right here.
Maybe he just went to the store.
He took his stuff. He's gone.  I should of seen this. I should of expected it. Bob doesn't have any character.
We said 48 hours.
Where was I?
You were asleep.
He told you and you let him do it.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
If you say so.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
OK.
Can you hand me those french fries.
Would of been nice.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
We need a car.
What?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I don't think we can do that.
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
She doesn't need to know.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
Shh.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
You don't know how to hotwire.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
Don't panic, Anthony.
I'm not. But there's --
Our money situation is not good.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
We've got sixteen dollars.
That's not correct.
Where's the rest?
How much?
She needed it.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Shut up!
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
Ah. Couple days ago.
Sure.
What is it?
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Who's Mr. Henry?
You'll meet him this afternoon. He's helping us set it up.
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Right now.
Let me feel that.
He seems pretty good.
Bob!
No, Dignan. This isn't --
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
I'm sorry, Bob.
Eleven fifteen.
OK. Mark that down.
I did.
It's like we've finally arrived.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
Did that hurt?
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
I don't think I ever said this to you. But it meant a lot to me the way you were after that Swifty stuff happened.
He was all right.
As a person?
Yeah. As a girl.
Yes. I do.
So do I.
You're all clear.
Roger.
We all set?
Hang on a second.
Take your second position.
OK. Roger.
Any activity?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Good. It's supposed to be.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
Stand by, Bird Dog.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
Applejack! What's happening?
Nobody move!
Get against the wall!
Careful. Check his pulse.
Where's Kumar?
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
Let's go. Come on.
I'll see you there.
What?
What are you talking about?
I'll get him.
There's not enough time.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
I don't think so.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
He did?
Yeah.
You got to be kidding me.
I'm not kidding.
What'd he get?
Pretty much everything.
The grandfather clock?
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
Oh, I'd say about --
Behind Bob's house.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
He stole a tractor.
You're kidding.
No. I'm not.
How?
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
What?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Dignan, I --
Scale the --
Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
Thanks.
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
Thanks.
Grammar.
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
So do I.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business?  You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
Hold it.
What do you mean?
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
Yes, he did.
How'd he do?
Me?
No, that door over there.
I don't want to die.
Are you afraid?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Death.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
No. Bob did.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Anthony, I'm petrified.
Yeah.
It's an esoteric journey.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Absolutely.
Why'd you want to help us?
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Who?
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Hector woudn't do anything.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Let them fight.
Yeah. He said that.
See you, Bob.
What was that?
There's a million places to hide around here.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
Move.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Nobody does.
OK, Dad.
He looked too shaken-up.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
Is that OK?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Why not?
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
You think I'm improving?
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
No, I don't mind.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
Sixty days?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Jesus Christ! No.
It was stupid.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing. I was just asking.
Sure.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
No.
I didn't do anything.
Who's got the car keys?
His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
Temporarily.
Dies y nueve.
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
No.
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
Oh, really? That's interesting. Do you prefer Cuba or the United States?
God, yes. Like silk.
Like silk?
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
You're Anthony?
Yeah.
I hear you're a good thief.
Uh-uh.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Uh-uh.
What do you mean?
Feel this.
The front stairs.
Where were you?
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Is that Buckethead?
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
True.
Bob! Get back in position!
You're the faggot.
I don't know about that.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
The one and only Little Richard.
I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
Not even for emergencies?
I thought your parents were in Italy.
They are.
So who's going to know?
My brother.
That never would of --
Let's cut the bullshit.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Can you use a coaster.
Yes. I did.
OK, Bob.
It's true, Dignan.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
I'll just drive my car.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
Good question.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
I can't believe you said that.
I told you he's crazy.
I warned you, Dignan.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look at her.
Maybe she turned.
Let's just go.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
That's my responsibility.
That's your domain.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
God DAMMIT.
Well, in reality it's not that dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
He electrocuted someone?
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
That's too bad.
You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
This is natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Did we get it?
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
Don't count it.
No. I was calm.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
I don't want to talk about it.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
I told you they were there.
So it's my fault?
There were more than that.
I don't know.
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
See you in a little while.
My brother's in jail.
What are you talking about?
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
They said he's a drug dealer.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
That could be anybody's.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
I don't know.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
This could be a trap.
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
I'm going back.
Not in that car you're not.
Watch me.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
I can't do that, Bob.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
I know it's not.
You don't even know his name.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
Just get in the car, Bob.
What's his name?
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
Let's go.
Anthony. Bad news.
Not bad.
Come on in. What you been up to?
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Yeah. It is.
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I never agreed to that.
Bob, you're lying!
Bullshit.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
I didn't have any choice.
That's OK.
Look. We want you on the job.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah?
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
He's having a heart attack or something.
Let's go!
I think so.
I didn't think there was an alarm.
Take him to the car, Bob.
Where's Applejack?
He's stuck between two floors.
Run. Run. Let's go.
What's that?
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Here we go.
Wait a second --
Now!
I'm working on it.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
I'm trying.
This boy's a troublemaker. He used to tear this place apart.
He said what?
He said you ran away from home.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
26 weeks.
And what does that cover?
Hand to hand combat?
Did you hear that?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
This is no good.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Oh, yeah.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
He's damn good.
We're just going over a few things.
Yes.
Why?
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
Who? Applejack?
Why did he go that way?
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
Can't get it. It won't...
What can we do?
Where's that guy going?
Well, I left some money in there.
Where?
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
You got that?
No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?
No, my friend knows her.
She Chicano, yes?
Sure.
Got a little lucky.
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
She is a good looking woman.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
What?
Fight. You know.
You Hoto?
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
Right.
Mr. Henry?
Come on in!
It's locked.
No, it's not.
Good to know you, John.
What?
The world needs dreamers. To relieve the pain of consciousness.
Pleasure to meet you, John.
Nice to meet you.
There was a mistake.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Will it track back to us?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
And the Landy woman?
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
Anything else?
One last push. One.
What do you mean?
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
Save it for Bourne.
What?
Bourne comes here? Why?
Never heard of it.
That's not gonna fly.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
I want to know about Treadstone.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
I want to know what happened.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
And Bourne? Where's he now?
I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
...this is Conklin's computer.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Do you know what his budget was?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
May I finish?
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Did he say anything to you?
No... It must have been Bourne.
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'm sorry, Ward.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
'Why' would be enough for me.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
Had to be done.
No good options left?
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
No. You lost your way.
Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
Thanks.
The sooner the better.
What do you have, Danny?
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
And?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
It was staged?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Jesus...
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Show me again...
Okay...
I speak English.
Okay.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
No, I do.
What?
Then what?
I killed them.
You killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
I don't want you to forgive me.
You're a liar.
You know I'm not.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Look at me.
I can't let you do that either.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Is this really happening?
I'm sorry.
Felt a little light.
Drop it.
Sorry. Old habits.
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Conklin.
He's dead.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
I don't know.
Who sent you to Greece?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
Pamela Landy?
I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
I'm sorry.
How long? How long do I have --
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- what? --
-- take the back -- get another car --
Conklin up front.
I'll get the book.
No. There's nothing new.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
-- it hasn't been two years --
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I worry when you get like this.
It's just a nightmare.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
I should be better by now.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
The Telegraph office.
But we were so careful.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
He was at the campground yesterday.
So...
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...
Where --
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
We can't wait to be sure.
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
What?
Switch! You drive!
-- where? -
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
-- not yet --
-- it's just him? --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- hang on --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There must be another way!
I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
There's no choice.
Tell me later.
But you found another choice.
I did.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
It might have.
You do?
I only dream about people who are dead.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Yes.
Who is Pamela Landy?
You hear me? I believed you.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
What is this, a game?
I want to hear it from you.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
A Russian?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
Last week? When?
I killed him???
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin!
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Abbott?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
So when was I here?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
No. You never worked Berlin.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
That's a lie!
You never worked Berlin...
I was here!
...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
Bourne?
I want to come in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Who?
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Careful...
What's that?
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
I'm working on it.
And the Germans can't match it?
Who's going? Us?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
What? The tapes?
Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
Here?
Is there. Is all there.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
That's where we came out.
It's a lot of money, Pam.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Still...
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Who's this?
Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
Me? Four years.
If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer...
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Amnesia?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Believed what?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So he fooled you.
If you say so.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Did you?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
And why is that?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Alright...
So?
Felt promising. It's a start.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
Are we locked up?
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
By who?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
Are we hacking or asking?
Yes. In that order.
And what about you, anything?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
I don't want to leave.
Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
It was in Latin, sir.
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We must sue for peace.
Peace?!
We cannot defeat this --
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
It is suicide.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
So let the council swear publicly.
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
He has already agreed to come.
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
He was a modest man.
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He will. I know he will.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
I have ordered conscriptions...
The Scots will fight for us?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Scotland. He intends --
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
You may.
You mock us with a smile?
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
When will his trial be?
Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
You fancy him.
I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
Hamish, I... thank...
Fourteen? --
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Aye.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
I rest.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
That's just a dream, William!
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
No. One of us is enough.
How many?
Three, maybe more!
Armed?
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
It's up to us, Hamish!
I wanna have supper waitin'.
You win.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
That depends on the man.
I could crush you like a roach.
I will not.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
In order to find his equal, and Irishman is forced to talk to God.  Yes, Father!...  The Almighty says don't change the subject, just answer the fookin' question.
A patriot!
We don't split up!
They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
Shall I leave, M'lord?
If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
No. He did not.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Humbly, M'lord.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
Let her speak.
He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
It matters not, he is thy king!
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
I do not confess.
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Thank you for accepting.
Thank you for inviting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
You are. And I'll come again.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
I... accept your proposal!
I'm not just saying it!
Nor I!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
You scare me.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
Tonight then.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
...Tonight!
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
I need you so much! I love you!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
How do you know this?
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
...I wouldn't know.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
It's battle I want, not talk.
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
That is not possible.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
It does me good to see you.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
If I swear to him, then everything I am is dead already.
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
I am trying.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I must... consult with my father.
And I will consult with mine.
They've tricked us.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Who would do such a thing?
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
What is it?
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
What?
When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Anything.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Why? What for?
And the bad news?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
But you must have something to go on?
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
How soon?...
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
Um... can dad come this time?
You know the answer to that.
Can't he come out for one day?
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
No.
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
My father has a bad memory, too?
Great. I'll see you soon.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I... I don't remember.
Okay.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I... I blacked out.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
Sure...
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
How long will I be in here?
I don't know. These things take time.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Cute, Evan.
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
Fix?
I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Can you protect me?
Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
Straight up.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Weirder than this?
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
So you believe me?
You know my father?
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Yes.
Where are you now?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Are you hurting her?
No, protecting her.
I see a car.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
My journals! Where are they?
But I... I need those books.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Photos?
I thought you were a December baby.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Like Ozzy.
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
What the fuck are you doing?
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
What?
Shucks, I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
Huh?
Fuck off, frat boy.
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I'm sorry.
Damn. Your dad did this?
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Duck, here they come.
Hi, Lenny.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
I've stopped a hundred times.
So how's Tommy?
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Not if you remember my dad.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Of course.
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
What do you want to know, Evan?
It was a long time ago.
I know, but...
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Those are your clothes, silly.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
I dunno.  Just being weird.
So it didn't feel... weird?
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
You'll see.
Go on. Sit down.
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
What do you mean?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Like how?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I walk differently?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
What?
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
I get it. You can drop it now.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Ha! Where's that?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Why's that?
Because you're... different.
Different? How?
Yeah?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Oh? There's proof now?
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Know what?
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
Which is?
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Stop! Take me back!
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I was?
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
And...?
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Then you think it might have worked out?
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
Who -- who are you?
...yes.
Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Been there, done that.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
We'll find out soon enough.
Me neither.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
Hey, I got no choice.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
And you are...?
Evan Treborn.
The answer's 'no', Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Gee, thanks friend.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Y... yes. I guess I did.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What?
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Destroy it?
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
What happened?? Where are we?!
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Huh?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
I come from a big family.
Meant no offense.
None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Sorry. Never heard of her.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
I thought I was the bad guy!
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
I'm sorry.
Oh my God oh my God...
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
You're such a retard!
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
I came with Captain Renault.
I should have known.
My husband is with me, too.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
No.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
He did. Captain Renault did.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
So you decided to go to America.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Yes, I'll bet.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Yes, Monsieur.
And you want to know --
-- Will he keep his word?
He always has.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
You want my advice?
Oh, yes, please.
Go back to Bulgaria.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
Well?
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
What is your name?
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
I'm sorry. It is.
Yes, Monsieur.
A champagne cocktail, please.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
No thanks, Carl.
Monsieur Rick!
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
I won't.
Goodnight.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
-- Tonight he forgot.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
Yes, sir.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I'm awfully sorry.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
That's all right.
I'd better be going.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
It's not for sale.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale at any price.
What do you want for Sam?
I don't buy or sell human beings.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Suppose we do.
My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Practically no one.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
And the carrying charges?
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Well, so long.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
Yes, something.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
Thank you very much. Good day.
Good day.
You needn't be concerned about me.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
There are only two other alternatives for him.
What are they?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
And the other alternative?
My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Not an easy day to forget.
No.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
I will.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Here's looking at you, kid.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Uh huh.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Looking for a job.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, of course, we --
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Oh, darling!
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Especially tonight.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Has it got a wow finish?
I don't know the finish yet.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
It doesn't matter.
Yes.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
The stairs from the street.
Richard, I had to see you.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Please.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Put them on the table.
No.
For the last time, put them on the table.
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
When did you first find out he was alive?
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
All except one. He won't have you.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
No, not yet.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Everything is quite all right.
Oh, Rick!
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
But Richard, no, I, I --
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
No.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
But what about us?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
And I said I would never leave you.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Does he always leave so early?
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
Won't you join us?
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
Be careful.
I will, don't worry.
Goodnight.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
No, Victor, no.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Yes, I would.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
We'll discuss it later.
I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Apparently he has the letters.
Yes?
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
He suggested I ask you.
Ask me?
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
-- Yes?
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
No, Victor, there isn't.
I love you very much, my dear.
Of course, I'll be careful.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Sam?
Yes.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Rick? Who's he?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
-- Is what?
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
You're saying this only to make me go.
How do you do?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
Won't you join us for a drink?
What for?
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
We all try. You succeed.
Not at all.
Any time.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Go ahead.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
My office.
Right.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
What of it?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
My wife?
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
Yes, rather.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
Yes, I get the point.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
You love her that much?
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
But we made a deal.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No. It's all arranged.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Yes.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Here it is.
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
We'll be there.
Goodnight.
I slept very well.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
May we proceed with the business?
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
-- Thank you.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Yes.
I believe you have a message for him?
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
Are you quite finished with us?
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
And that is?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Even in Berlin.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
Good day.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
What else, my dear Major?
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Good evening, Captain.
Thank you.
I expected no less, Captain.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
How about New York?
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
Perhaps.
Mademoiselle.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
And if it should change?
A leader, like Laszlo?
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
I see what you mean.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Find one.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
The clipper to America.
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I was misinformed.
Huh!
What, again?
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
A wise foreign policy.
Perhaps not.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo?
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Manages what?
His escape.
Oh, but I just told you. --
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
This is the end of the chase.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Okay.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Why two?
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
I have my orders.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
Excuse me.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
-- Thanks. I will.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Huh?
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Yeah? Why?
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Huh?
What friend?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Well, she isn't just any woman.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Oh, thanks.
Go ahead, Ricky.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Is everything ready?
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Sam's piano.
Serves me right for not being musical.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I have. Sit down over there.
Put that gun down.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
That is my least vulnerable spot.
You think of everything, don't you?
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
I think perhaps you're right.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Our expenses?
Uh huh.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Will I see you tonight?
I never make plans that far ahead.
Sacha, she's had enough.
Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Take your hands off me!
What is your nationality?
I'm a drunkard.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
I haven't the slightest idea.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Put that phone down!
Get me the Radio Tower!
Put it down!
Hello Ugarte.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
No.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
I don't want them here overnight.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
I like it fine here.
He'll double what I pay you.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Sorry.
Yeah?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Not right now.
No.
You ever going to bed?
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
Boss, let's get out of here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
Shut up and go home, will you?
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Uh, my watch stopped.
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
Just a little something of my own.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
No, I don't.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Yes, boss.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
So how are we going to get this place shaped up?
Worse than Warsaw.
Nobody remembers that.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
Feels so good to lie here.
You've had today's water.
Thirsty.
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
Do too much, I'll die.
Do too little you'll die.
Take it.
No.
Take it, damn it.
No.
Survive today, that's the point.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
Moon's too bright.
I'm putting it off.
Fix raft first.
Water water water --
You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Why do they have to die for me?
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
No!
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Die tomorrow or die today.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
Yeah, sure, what?
Thank you for fucking up my life.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
They're on autopilot.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Shut up.
You are.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
Nothing out there but ocean.
Then we've just got shit.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
There was an unavoidable delay.
No.
As much as anybody.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Okay.  Sure.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Yeah.  A long time ago.
They're harder to do than they look.
Oh?  You've tried?
Well, I do a little drawing --
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
Well, not really, I --
You are.  Yes you are.  What gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
No.  that was the last one.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
Sure.
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
Had a package to deliver.
You?  Personally?
I had it on the island with me.
Must be a story there.
I've got lots of time.
So do I.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Let's take a look.
Cold.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
I thought I did.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
He's your cute thing.
I can't even keep fish alive.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
And for you --
For when I travel?
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
You did?
You can't go now.
I have to.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Could you watch Jango?
No.
I can't take him to work.
There isn't any us.
Yes there is.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
I burned the Christmas tree.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Don't even start.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
I thought you might have.
I would never --
I know.
If I'd known you were alive --
I would have done the same thing.
Is that Jango?
No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
My epitaph.
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
What was inside?
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
Yeah?
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
Not when you have no choice.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
Great.  Really.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
It means a lot...that you came.
You too.
I'm so glad you're alive.
And how was your Christmas?
Terrific.  Yours?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Which I didn't have.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
I most definitely say I am.
Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Not to mention on me.
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
No.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Sure.
Yeah.
Let's eat.
So did I.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Mom, meet Jango.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
That new roof, that's your doing.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
Don't you even think about it.
The place is falling apart.
I'm doing fine.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
I wanted to come here.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
What about the sender?
Sure.  Bettina Peterson.  Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
Can you find her?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
It was fifteen minutes late.
But I might not have.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
I'm touched.
You fucked us over.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
Baloney.  I do see the damn "big picture."
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
For all those vacation days you got coming.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
Forget it.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
That's why you're a gambling man.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
For the third time.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
This was nothing like Warsaw.  I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
We're on.
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
It's me.
You're fucking dead!
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
Want to see my raft?
You should have smelled me.
I braided them.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
Time I had lots of.
Forty-three days.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
Hallelujah.
What's it all about?  It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
To life.
That's all there is.
Believe me I know.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
What?
That's what it's about.
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
I need to do it.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
Permission granted.
May I ask, where are you bound?
San Francisco.  And you?
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
Life is waiting.
You weren't dreaming about me.
I was!
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
They just want you to hire some new help.
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
Dr. Homer Wells.
I just hope he won't expect us to say *Grace* all the time.
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
I'm *not* a doctor!
I'm sorry, Homer.
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
Why not?
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
You cook very well!
And that I can drive a truck!
Better than I can!
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
I know.
I doubt it. She's just an...
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Good night, Daddy.
Daddy, *please*...
Good night, Daddy.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
I've never seen a lobster.
Really?
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Where's Mandalay?
Burma!
Oh...
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I understand.
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
Sure... I'll see you around.
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
Okay...
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
People watched the movies in their cars?
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
"King Kong". It's really good.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
Oh, sure!
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
Just a little privacy.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
Right.
It will be okay.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Well, we have to help her!
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
You don't understand! It's her father...
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
Nothing.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
He's *paralyzed*!
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
What do you want me to *do*?
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
"...did." Well, okay.
Please don't...
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
She knows how to take care of herself.
Sure. Thanks.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
Hi...
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
Yes, I *have*!
I can't go nowhere.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
I never said they were boring.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Well, they aren't.
Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
I know what you've been doing.
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
They wanted a girl.
Nobody ever wants me!
That's true.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
Nobody special enough, Curly.
You mean somebody asked?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
He's leaving...
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
Does he *know* he's supposed to be in India? Does he even *want* to come back?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?
*Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
But did you know him?
Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
What's a nanny do?
She looks after other people's children.
Did you grow up around here?
No. She was an immigrant.
What's an immigrant?
Someone not from Maine.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
That's why Kong loves her!
His father's dead, right?
Is that soon?
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
I don't remember.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
It's okay--I don't mind.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Really! Is it serious?
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
Where are you going?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Actually, I volunteered.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
Migrants?
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons.  The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
What about the trees?
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
Right.
Okay...
I guess so...
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You still doin' it too fast!
Is it true?
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Where'd she get you?
She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
Right?
Yes, for both.
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
It looks like scurvy.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
Obviously.
I don't know it.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
In other words, scurvy.
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
I haven't read that.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
It's my turn!
I don't think so.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
I'm happy I amuse you.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Of course.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
I don't need your gratitude.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
We heard that one already, Homer.
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
What you got a picture of your heart for?
So what?
Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
No trouble.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Almost.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Not yet. What do you know about it?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
That's it.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
When will he be home, Major?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Sorry, Homer...
We see you next harvest.
It look nicer then home!
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
I told him that you all is sick.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
What's lucky about that?
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
She took off in the night!
She took off on the bicycle, man.
He ain't never been outta Maine!
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Tough day?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Silicon Valley?
That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
I don't follow.
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
And you have this letter of intent?
Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
There'll be red flags.
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut.
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
Two million.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
Know who I am, Jake?
The Anti-Christ?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Gee... What makes you say that?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Just the last three weeks.
That's not a bad place to start.
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Isn't it always?
And these cops? What do they get?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
Factors that weren't clear to me until now.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Like what?
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
I was doing it for them.
BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
It's not true.
After you cut her loose.
She walked.
Today? Started off great...
Probably safe in the hands of the Federal Government.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Guess so.
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
So we go to the bar.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
We'll take care of it.
And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee?
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
What's a King Pin?
Mob?
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
So what? We hide, right?
No, that was the only semi-fucking smart thing he said! Except anybody that's ever met Big Al knows that the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating. This guys tells this guy, that guy tells some other guy, eventually it works it's way back to someone who works for the King and --
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Come on...
We're going to give him the money back?
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Let's go, Jake?
So what? We just stay clear of him.
Jake, I mean, come on --
I told you, use less powder.
But you won't get that splatter effect.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the "Send?" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin.
And what about Big Al?
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
Tonight. Just me.
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Two million.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
We pay better.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
She's up for it.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
You sure?
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Eight A.M. flight.
Calls?
We'll use the Euc.
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
That's it.
I'd like this cashed, please.
What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
I have a good crew.
Minus one.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
You can't cheat an honest man.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Because you killed one of my crew.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
No. Just confidence.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
I think two million.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
I need you to stake me.
Stake you?
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake.  And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
I said take off your fucking shirt.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
No thanks. I'm good.
Come here!
I think I just broke my hand.
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Ring it for him, Sobo.
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Something stupid.
Good boy.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Great. Thank you.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Very much so.
Sure.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
Help me.
You interested in a little work?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
Says who?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
What do I have to do?
I'll worry about Customs.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
Don't worry about it.
It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
What?
And some new clothes.
Why?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I don't trust anyone.
Then show me how.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Uh-huh.
I gotta go get a haircut.
Uh-huh.
Lighten up.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Did I miss something?
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
It's more than that.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
How do you know I will?
Intuition.
Don't ruin this for me.
WHAT?
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
Sounds respectable.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Glenn talked you out of it.
Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
Lily... Jesus Christ...
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
I don't know. I packed up my shit and ran away. To this... So unlike you, I guess I do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
What about what?
No, I want my cut!
I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
What do you want? An apology?
No, I want my cut!
Your mess.
Then shut up.
My place.
You sure we're clear?
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Miles...
Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
I'm getting a ride.
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
What do we need another Shill for?
Breasts.
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
What?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
We never had a problem with that before.
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
We're getting a little old for running.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
You sure?
Where the hell is she?
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
Escorts!
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
And we got rid of the red head.
Jake? Customs?
Do you have a ticket?
You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
What was it?
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
With identification.
I'm sorry.
This is embarrassing.
You going to have the time?
I'll find the time.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
You're a weasel.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
That was fucking deep.
Keep it up.
That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
What?
Stand up.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
Eee Oott Auught!
Sorry. What?
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Pretty much.
In over your head?
Pretty much.
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
A little bit of both.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
Can't say.
Then who's the Banker?
The King.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
It's not history.
So what do you want?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
Confidence. It's just confidence.
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
I try.
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
A Fed? Is he close?
I don't think so. Their Fix gave us the heads up and Jake's got a plan that'll probably keep him off.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
Let's just say he burned me once.
We're here.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
What do you want?
What do you get out of it?
Peace of mind.
That's it?
Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice?
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
Roger that.
To who?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
It's just insurance.
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm down!
High five.
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
Is it that bad?
How do I look?
No. Thanks.
My car's in the garage.
Maybe another time.
I'll take you up on that.
Goodnight.
It's the tension.
All men are cheats.
Why did you quit?
I got scared.
I can imagine.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
Well it is. But I know where I am.
I despise the job.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Not like Matt, you mean.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
Sorry.
What are you talking about?
I don't know anything about it.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
You're all scumbags.
A couple I know are getting married.
What's the Blue Book price?
How about five hundred.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Eight-fifty.
Seven-fifty.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
She went back to South Africa.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
We all played the field.
I want a job, Giles.
All right. As what?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
I'm working on that soccer story.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Habib?
My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.
Looking forward!
South African women are very sporty.
Who was he?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble.
Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work.
And your lady?
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
Not entirely.
How's that football story corning along?
You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business.
You mean I won't resist them.
You want me drunk?
I won't be that long.
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
Turn around.
I. sold the car.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
I've got something to tell you.
I've got a job.
What job?
How did you land that?
It came my way. 450 a week.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
I had training. In the Republic.
I start Monday week.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
I love you Jack, you know that.
You've got such beautiful hands.
I don't know.
Fine.
Tension. It'll go.
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Are you drunk?
Probably.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
Marion, stop this.
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
What about a drink on the way home?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
I'm on at nine.
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
Why not?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Marion. It's a book.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
It's the truth.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
Leave it.
No. Answer it!
I hope it brings you luck.
It will.
You're entitled to your opinion.
You will?
Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
You were talking in your sleep.
Not talking. Writing.
Never. Why do you ask?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Gambling's not about money.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Then what?
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
You're already alone.
I hate public transport.
What?
How can anyone be that naive?
Found a job?
Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
It's not that.
I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Yes, I know that.
Don't let yourself down.
I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
You know where I'm from?
Well, thank you anyway.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
Impossible to calculate.
There's a casino in this hotel.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
So why did you come to my casino?
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Near the casino.
In the casino.
Your father?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
The debts.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
Absolutely not.
Toss you for it.
I don't gamble.
Just an accident. Nothing.
Turn left ahead.
That's fine.
I'll watch.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
You don't like cheats, do you.
You choose.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I didn't.
Then you're not a pro.
What kind of trouble?
I owe a lot of money.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
I know that. But you can now.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
Who's they?
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
The point is, they want a man inside.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
Robbery's not criminal?
You're serious.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
It won't.
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
Reynolds? You've done your research.
What about my neck?
I can't do it, Jani.
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
Wait a minute...
Let it go.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
I told you, all bets are off.
What for?
I have to take the car.
Thank you.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Yes.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
I've still got mine.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
No thank you.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Jack! It's Jani.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
How are you?
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Did you solve your problems?
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Ross.
Who did it? Tell me!
You did?
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
And what do you do, Lucy?
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
I might.
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Turn left at the lights.
Have you got transport?
Thanks.
Nice car.
She's my baby.
How long have you worked at the casino?
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
You've done pretty well.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
Some other time.
What the fuck are you talking about?
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
I'm not going to report it.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
You're talking about complicity.
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
And the girls?
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Good call. Help yourself.
That bitch? No.
No thanks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I don't gamble.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Don't worry.
Rough life, Jack.
I'll tell you later.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
I put them on together.
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
It was you, you shit.
Jack.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
No.
I was at Beadles.
I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
We check every four days.
Why four? And not three or five?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Any exceptions?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Give me 365.
We do.
Where's the magnet?
They've been tested.
I don't think so.
Wipe your hands.
What happens if I want to sneeze?
Five.
I make it six.
Good call.
I said good call.
What for?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
I don't gamble.
Ever?
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
How?
First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
Yes.
No.
We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
Fine.
That hair will have to go.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Does he win?
He's a good customer.
I can see.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
She was a real asset. But what could I do?
Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
Right, that checks out here.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
What flickering light?
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Oh. What's wrong now?
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
I hope it's not the oven again.
Yeah.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
Eventual supernova.
Look, bomb...
I think he's talking to it.
Key? Key? What is the key?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key!
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
Where is the key?
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Oh, God...
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Doolittle, are you there?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Time to start talking.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Fuck that shit.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Well, there's the possibility of...
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
All right, then...
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Energy shielding positive function.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Check at six minutes.
Arm yourself, bomb.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Thanks.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Armed.
Thanks.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
No.
Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Hello, bomb.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Bomb?
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Of course.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
I am always receptive to suggestions.
But how do you know you exist?
It is intuitively obvious.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Right!
This is fun.
All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That's it.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Why don't you have more time?
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
To explode, of course.
And you can only do it once, right?
That is correct.
Of course not.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Yes, well...
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
Hmmm...
So if you detonate in...
...nine seconds...
I have no proof that it was false data.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Yes, Doolittle.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Doolittle...
Yes.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
In a second.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Which one?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
Any planets?
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Any of 'em any good?
Naah. All stable.
What?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Commander Powell is dead.
Fred.
Wha?
I hereby name this star Fred.
Out where?
Veil nebula.
Who cares?
Ah, negative drop.
-- automatic channels open --
-- Remark.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Oh, sure.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
I like it up here.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Not now!
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
What happened, Doolittle?
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Guess you're right.
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Phoenix?
No kidding?
Yeah?
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What's that, sir?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Ah... pity, pity...
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Ah, so many malfunctions... why don't you have anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the azimuth clutch?
What was that, Doolittle?
Negative effect.
It didn't work?
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Well, what you might try is --
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sorry.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Sir?
Talk to the bomb.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Sir?
Phenomenology...
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
No?
No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
How I make my living, what's your point?
This.
I'm on a break.
Guess again.
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
Yeah?
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
What?
That's not why we're here.
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
What're you talkin' about?
That's a lotta crap.
How come I never hearda you before?
I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
He's got exposure.  He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
You know each other?
Leave.  Now.
Can I say something in my defense?
No.
Where?
You mean until you showed up?
You're not still pissed?
Justine was not an unwilling participant.
She was there...
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Could you give us a moment.
It was a complicated situation which could have been misconstrued, causing you to maybe take offense.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
You're roommates?
Police drone.
What?  Where're we going?
Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
Don't look down.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Same old story.  Not interested.
Thought I'd let you have first crack... Later.
A grand.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Later.
I don't get involved with guns.
I'll make it worth your while.
It's a rule.
Am I?
I got overhead...
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
Yeah, me too.
Yech...
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
You didn't...
Every week.
They took my daughter.
I know.
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Can you help me get her back?
Look, I'd really like to...
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
What else can we do?
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.
I don't want to move away.
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
But why can't we stay here?
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
No...
Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
Mommy, where are you?
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
When?
Soon, baby.
Mommy, I'm scared.
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
Girl's gotta make a living.
First time I ever heard that.
I was expecting someone else.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
Whoever that is.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Who is...
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
Logan Cale.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
The one you're wearing?
Wasn't that hard.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
Too early to tell.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Lauren's not my wife.
Girlfriend?
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Something.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Yeah...
I won't be staying.
I'm not a half bad cook.
It was open.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
Bent?
Bent.
How do I know you didn't?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
That would be appropriate, yes.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
We are not fine.
Yes on all counts.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
You need to get out more.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
The other ones?
The other one like you...
You lost me.
C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
You did go through my stuff.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
How well do you remember the lab?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
How much do you know?
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
A girl.
Your basic hodge-podge.
Hardly...
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
You said you could help.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
What's in it for you?
Your help.
I already don't like the sound of this.
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
Somebody's got to.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
I'm sorry.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
You believe that?
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Well, not me personally.
That's what soldiers do, right?
Open it.
I don't know what to say.
Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
Look, thank you for this but--
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
We're quoting Mom again.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
With your help.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
Ladies would be elsewhere.
You don't want to.
But she does work here?
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
I need to talk to her.
Can't help you.
Any idea when she'll be back?
I'll wait.
A friend of your fiance's.
What do you want?
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
Look, I don't know what you want--
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Oh?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You're also a fool.
I think you should go now.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
Let go of my hand.
Okay, okay.
I understand.
And if I ever catch you coming near my man again...
You did.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
Right here someplace.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Thank you.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Then what?
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
Nothing on Hannah?
A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
Here's your money.
How's this about me?
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
You're crazy.
I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
You and me both.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
Got a pencil?
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
I'm on my way.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Straight.
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
I just don't go in with any expectations.
What?
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
No.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Yeah.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
You know what I'm saying.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
How long you and me known each other?
A long time.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
A fog bank.
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Where?
It's a secret.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Unlikely.
And because he's my friend.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
Please...
They're prisoners to their genes.
So are dogs.
Only one I can think of.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
I actually know how this works.
You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
Pull the cash.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
And she bought that?
I have sincere eyes.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
She's got my word.
She's gonna want to hear for herself.
You get it when I get her.
Okay...idea.  Compromise, right?  Bruno here comes with me.  He holds the money until mommy shows up, then we close escrow.  What you do with her after I'm gone doesn't keep me awake nights.
You're the best, Maxie.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
What if he's on the level?
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Later.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
But I'll take a rain check...
We gotta talk.
What's up?
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Max--
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
You left out condescending.
But there's another side--
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
I'm the victim here.
Really?
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Exactly.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Does this person have a name?
Lydia.
And Lydia telling Natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way?
I'm a toy to her.
A toy?
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
And why should she?
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
She tells you how I've been--
--a philandering pig.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
How'd you get her out of town?
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
I'll give it my best shot.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You don't.
Easy Sketchy.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
She was the one--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
True, but--
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Okay, okay, okay--
Say the words, "I understand."
I was on call.
I want you on call here.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
He's sick.
For a change.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
Huh?
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Who's Whiskey Dick?
My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw...
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
No, I mean... you love your son?
More than anything in the world.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
Hawk.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Got any KISS?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
I-I c-can't...
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
Thanks.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Believe it.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Right, slow...
Oh, screw it!
I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
Bye.
What's it worth to you?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
What? That's disgusting!
You got in the car, didn't you?
Whatever... stella.
Yeah.
For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
What's in Sandusky?
Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize.
One more time in English.
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
YO, DOOFUS!
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
Check!
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Damn straight we are.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Sunday, but...
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
Curly.
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
The paint!
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
Cool, bro, now listen up...
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Tickets?
Nah. Couldn't be.
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
And if it ain't cleaned off?
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Oh, yeah...?
Sure.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
The easy way.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
Hawk?
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
It's my Bullworker.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
What's gone?
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now!
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school.
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
Check.
Check.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again.
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
NOW!
Uhh... nothing.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
But, mom!
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Grounded for the rest of the year?
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
What?!
I said, I'm sorry!
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
That's it?
Yeah.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
No.
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
No...
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Was it a teddy?
A bustier?
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
We won?!
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Hello summer detention.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
What do you want?
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks.
The KISS Army!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Not if I shoot first!
I don't even think you have a gun!
Neither do I!
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Yeah.
Yeah, you did!
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
Good morning...
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Good MORNING!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
GOOD MORNING!
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
What happened?
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Yeah.
Did you know him?
Donnie.
I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Theoretically.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
So... that's it?
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
A metal craft of any kind.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Like a spear.
Beg pardon?
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
I'm not following you.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
Not until like... eighth grade.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
I'm telling Mom.
Donnie! Give it back!
I didn't say shit.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
You know what? I think that you did it.
What did you say?
Our saviour...
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Who is... we?
You'll know soon enough.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You have to do something for me first.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Take it off. I want to see you.
Why do they call you Frank?
How much longer is this gonna last?
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
We went to a hotel.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
I don't wanna talk about it.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
Hey...
School's cancelled.
Sure.
Fuck them.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
What makes you think I'm not?
That's easy. Antiseptics.
You mean soap?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Wonder where we'll be then.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Until it withers away.
We never would have had this conversation.
I'm sorry.
That was a compliment.
Will you go with me?
Where are we going?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Sure.
I'm going home.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
And you'd never been there before?
Yeah?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
With, like, images?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
Well...
You want to kiss me...
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
What?
Are you okay?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Who?
Maybe she's asleep.
Infant Memory Generators.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
The whole movie. Let's go.
What's wrong with you?
What do you mean?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Hey. You OK?
My mom is gone.
Where is she?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
But you're OK?
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
It's safe here.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Where are we going?
Why? Is this about the book?
No. Frank.
Who's Frank?
Yeah...
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
When did you stop taking your medication?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
That is a terrible nickname.
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
Do you get to meet Ed?
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
It feels wonderful.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Do they know yet?
Know what?
Where it came from?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
Grandma Death.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
I know, Dad.
I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Why should we care?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Where are you going?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
His name is Frank.
Frank.
How so?
Don't you watch the news?
I don't own a television.
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
He said to follow him.
Follow him where?
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
Yes.
I met a girl.
What is her name?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Yes.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
Who is the boss?
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
What about your family, Donnie?
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
Four times... so far.
Can anyone else see him?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
A sign from whom?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
How does that make you feel?
Is Callie still around?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Do you feel alone right now?
No. That makes you keep searching.
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
What did you find?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
I know.
The good stuff.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
Yes.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
I... I was playing with fire.
Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Yes. I went to jail.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
You've done it again?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
I think now that he might...
Why?
God exists because you're horny.
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
Where are we going?
I have the power to build a time machine.
How is that possible?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Then how is time travel possible?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
When will this happen?
Soon. Time is almost up.
Where is he, Donald?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Yeah.
What's her name?
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Why would I tell Mom?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
I was just being honest.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
That's a nice name.  OK, let me see it.
Congratulations.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Gerald.
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
Well, I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
What I think is going on with your son.
Well, you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
Come again?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Frank?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You're not a bitch.
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
Donnie? You're a dick.
You can suck a fuck.
How did you know --
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
What else?
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
Yep.
How did this happen?
I guess they made him do it.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
Kitty...
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Beg pardon?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
But now you can't go.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
Go back to China, bitch!
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
There's no rule!
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
Raspberry.
No more fuckin' for her.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Not Vanity. He's a homo.
I stole four beers from my dad.
She's alive, sweetie.
Where is she?!
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh God, I'm dead...
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Yeah, you betcha...
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Oh-yah.
Really, Loretta?
You-betcha.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Loretta, never have kids.
Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could.
Thank God for bunge cords.
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Really?
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Okay.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
This came for you, sweetie.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
Airport Ho-Jo!
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
I gotta work with these women.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
I can't believe this is happenin'. I can't believe she said you couldn't...
"Here," wh-wh-what?
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
Your parents'd kill you.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Yah?
Oh-you-beccha.
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Huh?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
-- red nose and ears. I know, I know.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
That's my mom.  I'll get 'em in a sec.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
What?!
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
I love you much.
We was robbed.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
We all do. Now let's go.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
This, this... This is bullshit!
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
You heard me. Where is it?
I just did.
Well then, you better be willin' to back it up, 'cause you're talkin' like crazy.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds.
Bitch!
Here, have some.
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Yeah...
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes, Leslie!
Hi.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Then it must be Wednesday.
I know.
So if, uh, you wanted to do somethin'...
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Okay... well, bye.
Bye.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Are we on "Cops" again?
You could be quiet.
Hi.
Hi.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
Oh, naw. Hi.
This here's Loretta.
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Shut it up, Loretta.
Oh, Christ, it's true.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
I'll be right back. See ya later.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
You don't know where this is gonna...
I got a hairdo.
So? Be real easy.
Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over.
Anyone?
Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit.
Okay. Take her purse.
They told me to practice.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
My dress'll reek.
Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
That's right.
Okay?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Ohio...
That bitch from...
What?
Wisconsin.
All right, then.
The bitch.
The important thing is that we have a winner...
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
And the year before that?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
Yeah.
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
Gladys! Stop it!
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
Becky was my only shot at state!
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Nothin' too showy!
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
All right, let's go.
"Proud... to be... an... American."
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Yeah.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
Uh, Gladys?
What!
We need more bars!
This is -- what?
Enid ate a whole pan!
I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
Harold!
Close up shop!
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
He should be king!
And wear a crown and everything.
And everything.  He should be king!
The king can do no wrong!
Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
The king can do to wrong!
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
They think I should - They think I should - They think I should - They think I should be king.
Take a letter.
Who to?
The President of the United States.
"My dear President"...
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
"My dear"...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
"My"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
"My dear"...
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
Is that all?
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
I'll have to enclose the check first.
You do and I'll fire you.
Send for my car...
His Excellency's car!
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
But you're my father -
Never mind then, I'll get in touch with him myself -
We'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.
Take a letter...
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
Yes, sir.
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
Yes -- why?
I wanna powder my nose...
He could be playing solitaire, but I don't think so.
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
All right -
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
What kind of a dog is he?
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Half watch dog?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
What do you whistle?
Yankee Poodle.
I don't want him.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
He only weighs ten ounces --
I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
Oh no, I can't do it.
You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Did you shoot the rapids?
No, but I shot some ducks.
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
What other job you got?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I don't wanna work at all.
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
'At's-a fine.
What do I get?
You get half mine and I get half yours.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
Why wasn't I insulted?
You was insulted, but you don't know it.
Then I demand an apology!
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
She did.
What did you say to her?
You told it to me.
Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army.
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
That's not bad for any day.
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
I can't do it...
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Anything else?
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Fine.  We gotta him.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Sure.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
He's working very hard - I got him a job driving Firefly's car - He's-a driving him crazy and I'm driving him nuts - P-E-A-N-U-T-S
It must be done right away.
I can't do it right away.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Are you getting tired?
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
$50?
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Go ahead.
And Vera niece, too.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
You swine!
Give me that again!
You worm!
Once more!
That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
Yes.
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Bah!!
THEN IT'S WAR!
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
I don't remember.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Was it -- swine?
No... it was a seven letter word.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
That's it...
I still like UPSTART the best.
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
Your Excellency!
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Let him patch up his own breeches...
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me.
Now -- er --
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
Why -- why -- of course.
You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
Take a seat -- you're next.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
WHAT  ?
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
But -
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
The king can do no wrong!
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
I didn't come here to be insulted.
Oh, would you...?
For you, I would do anything...
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
I thought everything was working out fine.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Yes please, two.
One or two?
Two, please.
Oh?
How lovely.
I've always thought that myself.
Oh, yes.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
I'll join you shortly.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
No, I think a whiskey.
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
What do you mean?
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
Well, these things take time.
I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
Do you?
And here are my mother and father.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Hmmm?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
That I am very little different from him.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Oh Frederick.
Yes?
Did you see it?
What is it?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
I'll show you! I'll show you!
Shut up!
What do you mean?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I intend to.
He fell.  He falls.
He must have taken quite a fall.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die.  Head's too heavy.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
Everything will be seen to.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Never mind that, I want my man!
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
You don't own this man!
I want him back!
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
Right... Right.
Good morning, sir.
You've acquired a taste for this?
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Indeed!
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Yes sir.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Good! How is the patient?
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
...Yes, Sir.
Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
I don't understand.
Tell me, John, how did you know the rest of the 23rd Psalm?
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
No you can't. You can't begin to know, no one can.
I could easily arrange...
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Well, yes.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Please do.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
I feel much better. Thank you.
Are you comfortable here?
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
I am very pleased to meet you.
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
Three quarters of an hour.
Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
What a mess.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
Nothing of any importance, eh?
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Oh, no.
I knew you'd understand. Here.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Yes.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
You've never been?
Alas, no.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Tell me about it, please!
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Romance!
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
No, but I certainly shall.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Oh no?
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
How awful for John.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Is he... dying then?
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Yes.
y-y-yes--
Want to come out?
You're English.
Of course! You want out?
Yes.
Won't be a moment.
Oh no, my friend...
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
Oh, yes.
You know, I saw you once there, in London. You're a great attraction.
Yes.
No, nothing.
Good morning.
Yes.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Thank you... very much.
Where did you get this box?
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
The main spire.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
...I learned a long time ago.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yes John!
Yyess.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Yes!
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Yes.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Hello...
My name is...
My... name is...
John Merrick.
John... Merrick
Say "Merrick".
Merrick...
Mmmerrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Hello... my name is... John Merrick.
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Righteousness...
Righteousness for his namesake.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
But the variety of food here is very pleasing... I commend you.
You did not ask me.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.
Yes.
The hospital?
Of course! What did you think?
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
Thank you very much.
When one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
That's a canopy, John.
Ohhh...
How is your tea, John?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
Of course.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
Your mother?
Here.
Good morning.
John, there's someone here who would like to meet you. Would that be alright?
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Yes, John?
...Can you cure me?
I thought as much.
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
You did this for me?
Yes.
Please... please thank the governing committee for me. I will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Oh, Mr. Treves. Mr. Treves.
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Oh no, I couldn't.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
No, John, not one that I can see.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Fine.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
I've heard.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Yes... Yes, let's go in.
Yes! The workhouse!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
No, he's very upset about something.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Yes sir.  What's that?
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.
A dressing bag?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Well...
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
Welcome home, John.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Pardon me?
Never mind. I'm the owner.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Ah! It's my father!
Open up! I know you're in there!
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
There IS no one.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
You're losing your temper!
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
It's your fantasy...
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
I said welcome.
WELCOME?
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
What?
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
Yes.
But surely you know...?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
But you LOVED her all the same...
We never went to bed together.
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
I've never LOVED anybody!
"The fifth one this week"!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
And I thought you said it was something special...
Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.
Who?
Halfdan the Black.
But, Erik...
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Why?
I'll bring it back.
Erik. You don't understand.
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
But you don't realize....
Goodbye, Aud...
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
That's right!
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Of course.
Do you believe I love you?
I... but I...
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Yes -- I believe you do.
Then let go!
The second note to wake the Gods...
Not quite...
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
No... no...
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
It was my master Keitel's idea.
What d'you mean?
We blew the Horn Resounding.
I shouldn't have come.
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Is it night or day, Erik?
It is day, of course, Freya.
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
I will go and wake them up!
That I cannot tell you.
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well... isn't it great?
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
You're just saying that.
Really.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
You've got to let me go!
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Why?
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Don't talk nonsense.
He wants to kill US!
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Yes... oh, yes...
Then I expect you'll be leaving first thing in the morning.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.
What about the raping?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
Sh!
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
What -- rape?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...
I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
About raping me?
About NOT raping you...
You DON'T like it, do you?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
Well you started it.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Ah.
Louder.
Oh, thanks.
I didn't mean to!
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
What a stupid idea.
Why?
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
Well... no...
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
Odin!
Find it... AND cross it!
But...
What?
Come on, move it!
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
It saved my father!
Very deep... usually...
No.
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
I know!
He wants to KILL us.
I know. I know.
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
You talking piffle, son?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Who have you been talking to?
I met this girl...
She got me thinking...
So? What'd you do to her?
That's my boy!
Well, you ARE!
Row! Row! Row!
Sorry.
Sorry!
Make your mind up.
You may need a real Berserk.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
ROW!
The sun! That's it!
What "magic"?
You'll see!
Look out!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Why should WE care?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
So?
But you're the Gods!
Look... Erik...
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Trust me to get the missionary.
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Well, come on!
Like fish.
To the oars!
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
You'll be sucked down too!
No! Arrgh!
Who gets killed?
Nobody gets killed.
Oh... er... yes...
Just say something cheerful.
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
No, don't say anything else!
Keitel Blacksmith?
What's the matter with Bjorn?
But how could he know... unless...
How about making friends?
What is it?
What are you talking about?
I will join my grandfather there.
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
We'd be the first!
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
I was sitting there.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
We haven't got a spare place.
DEATH!
She MUST have a knife or something...
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Over the Edge of the World.
Let me do something for myself for a change!
I have to go...
Bye... sorry...
Yeah... well...
You will wait?
What d'you expect me to do?
Please.
The Dragon...
What do we have to do?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
Do what?
Vanish into thin air?
Well, where is he then?
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
You're wasting your time.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
Same thing, isn't it?
No, it is NOT.
Your lord.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
No, I'm not.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
Bastard.
That's it!
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
Mum! Dad!
Got you!
What are you talking about?
I'm not worth risking your life for.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Hang on...
I... I...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon...
Oh...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
Get away, Snorri.
What have you got there?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
You could charge him what you like.
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
Can't make enough swords!
Can't make enough axe-heads!
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
That's right.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Well... I... I thought...
How can we stops him now?
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
I'm drowning! Help!
Help!
You'll drown us bo...
Help!
She knows it was our fault!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
You fool!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
I know, Dad.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
You went berserk...
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
So did your father...
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I must only let the red rage...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
Not now, Sven...
I must KILL! Kill!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Stop it!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Sh!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
Easy, Dad!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Dad!
I hate you! I hate you!
You liar!
Neither am I.
Me too.
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
No... he's not... not... there...
Tell him I'm coming!
Yes, Mother.
And something to sharpen them with?
Yes, Mum.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
No, Mother.
And keep your sword greased.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
I never do...
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
Sweetie, we called the company.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
Say hi to Naomi.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
I remember.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Yeah, you told me that later.
I told you that later.
No one.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
And I just liked you so much.
You did? You liked me?
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
Okay, I guess.
Here we are.
You were not.
I was not.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
You rat.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
In the room?
In the world.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
Oh, Tangerine.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
Okay, I guess.
Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Why what?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Oh. So...
It's okay, really.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Rockville Center.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Really? Because --
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I don't have one.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I can't remember.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
I don't really know how --
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
I'm sure you would.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm Joel.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Huckleberry Hound?
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
I'm not nuts.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Well, anyway... Sorry.
Okay.
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Yes?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
That's okay.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Probably see you at the book store.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You're sure? It's cold.
It's okay.
Yeah?
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
I'm not a stalker.
You know Wilmont?
Yeah.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
I like to read.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Sort of, um...
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
What?
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Um --
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Very much.
This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I don't know.
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Frost?
It's pretty.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
Cheers.
I'm fine.
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
No, I'm okay for now.
You pick it.
You just say. I'm not really --
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
No. I --
I know a man who needs a refill.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Yeah?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
I don't know.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Yeah, I guess.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Thanks.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Yeah.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Yeah.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
No.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
No, not at all.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
Oh, yeah.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
That's scary sounding.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
I think so.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Okay.
Yeah? Oh, great!
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You should stay.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
Okay.
Yes.
You'll call me, right?
Yeah.
When?
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Okay.
You didn't say anything about my hair.
It's three.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
Let's talk about it later.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
I don't want to talk about this here.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
Would you get me another, Joely?
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
No, it isn't that.
I want to know you.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Joel, you're a liar.
Yeah, Tangerine?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
No.
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
Oh?
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
What?
Really? Is he cute?
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
I love it!
This is our first "date" date.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Naomi, I guess.
Yeah.
What was I wearing?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Egad, were you horrified?
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
And I didn't have an argument.
Come up and see me... now.
It's very late.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Is that what you want?
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Yeah?
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Well, you're married.
Not yet. Not married.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Okay.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
I remember that speech really well.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You had the whole human race pegged.
Probably.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I know.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
You said --
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
I'm Joel.
Yeah, like that.
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
What do we do?
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
yeah?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Okay.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I love her.
I think she's great.
Me too. There's this poem --
I think, before.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
Um, no.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
Female.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
What are you doing?
It's freezing out here.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Naomi.
I think we should go.
No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
What if you stay this time?
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
I love you.
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
I don't know.
Joel, come here. Please.
Make love?
Have sex. Y'know --
Oh, um...
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
That's okay. I --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Hey, Joel --
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
Says you were a bully...
A bully? Moi?
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
I don't know.
Doesn't sound like me.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Oddly enough, I do.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I guess so.
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
You must have been crazy.
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Jesus.
Hi.
How's it going?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I just got in.
Long day thinking.
There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
I'm like a joke to them.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Fuck you, Clementine.
The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
It's too late.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
That's your look for me.
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Any messages, Carmen?
And what are you like? A wino?
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
Well... I did.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
You have to stop this!
What? What do you mean?
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
You take it. I don't know.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
What?
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
It's not somebody else.
Hi.
How was it?
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Go back to sleep.
In a minute.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
I hope you get your work done.
Yeah.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I'm sorry.
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
I miss you.
Oh! Great. That's great!
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
I'm glad you called.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
We'll speak soon.
'Night.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Nah, I don't know.
Yeah. Cool.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Hi.
It's just... y'know... I mean...
I know. Anyway --
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
'kay.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
I better do this, Stan.
You found us okay?
We haven't checked.
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
That's a good one.
It's a good one all right.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Yup.
Go.
Yeah.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
You love him, don't you?
What?
Listen, it's not erasing.
Where?
I don't know. He's not on the map.
Well, what should we do?
I don't know! I just said that!
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Shit!
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
You better go.
Hell no.
Do you swear you didn't know?
I swear.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
Once, maybe.
How did I look?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Thanks, Stan.
Hi.
Can I... I brought some --
Nothing.
Then why did you ask me?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Yes?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Welcome, Howard.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Well, thank you, Mary.
How do you mean?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
Is that Nietzsche?
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
Alexander Pope?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's no big deal.
You are such a sweetheart.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have an abortion.
It was a mutual decision.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Well, where was Patrick?
He went home sick.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
She came to help, Howard.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Oh dear.
That's fine, Stan.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Jesus.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Of course. Please have a seat.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Yeah.
Just wanted to let you know.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
You can if you want.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
This one's history. Moving on...
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Patrick, we need to focus.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Jesus, Patrick!
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
It's a quote book.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
I know who you are.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
Save your breath for the climb.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
Clockworks?
Siwash, huh?
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
The Clock People?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
You mean she's dead?
Easy come, easy go.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
That's your problem.
I'm staying with the Countess.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
I don't.
You don't?
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clich�s and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
What is Debbie's position?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
Like what?
Well.... er...
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Whose fault was that?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
What guy?
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
I have to go, Julian.
Why? Why do you have to go?
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
I was a successful model once.
For magazines?
So now you're bummin' around?
Yep.
Hitchhiking?
I'm the best.
You're the best?
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
Whooee!
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
Tired...
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
A born freak can only go uphill.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
Your ranch?
Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
A job for me?
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
But Countess...
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
I don't know anything about it.
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
I heard it.
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
I'd rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. Now step aside, old man.
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
Justin?
I think I found something...
Don't start with me, Cooper.
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
I'll be all over it.
Coop, where are you...
I'll get him.
On my way.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
Will it work?
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
What?
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
What?
Coffee.
Skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
No, he didn't.
You weren't there. I saw it.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
It is not.
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
You're okay now, it's over...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Can you shut it down?
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
Hurry.
Run!
Trauma.
And this is mission specialist Dr. William Weir. We all know where we're going. Dr. Weir is going to tell us why.
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
We'll make it.
"Another man?" Who?
No.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
Go on.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
It gets worse.
Hear what?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
No. I don't believe in that sort of thing.  But if Dr. Weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. Who knows where this ship has been... What it's seen...  And what it's brought back with it.
What happened?
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Please... kill...
Oh God...
A power drain --
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
Pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .
He's crashing...
His peritoneum has ruptured...
One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
Thank you.
Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
Does he know that?
What's on your mind?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
Some things you don't get over.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
What does?
The dark inside me.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
From the Other Place...
Starck!
I built it.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
I'm going in.
Start the countdown.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Justin.
Skipper, you gotta help me...
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
Justin. I won't let you die.
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
Starck, you still showing those readings?
There's no one here, Skipper.
What you got, Peters?
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Alive?
Frozen.
...how's the client?
Crystallized.
Skipper...
Peters...
...you okay?
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
Do it.
Justin.
I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there...
Thanks.
The clock is running, Dr. Weir. If you'll follow the rest of the crew, they'll show you to the gravity tanks.
Doctor Weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. We were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
Be careful. It's not a load bearing structure...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
That is not acceptable --
-- once we've secured the ship, that's the way it is!  I need you to guide us from the comm station. This is where I need you. Help us to do our job.
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Negative.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
It's complicated...
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
If it worked.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.
The date.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
It's 2041...
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
I don't know.
The Core...!
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
I think I can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
Do it.
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
What do you want me to say?
Yes...
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
I don't know...
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I don't know...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
You can't, your orders are specific...
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Don't... don't do this...
It's done.
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
You... You can't do that!
Watch me.
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
What are you talking about?
What makes you think I'll miss?
Then who the fuck are you?
Your fear. Do you remember the Goliath, Miller?
You know.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
I'm not the Devil.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
Better if I just show you.
You're lying...!
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
Starck... Cooper...
NOOO!
Locked and cocked.
What is that?
One-four degrees...
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Something like that, yeah.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Weir...!
I noticed. Starck, anybody home?
Where is it?
Starck...
Love to.
Starck, give me a read.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
We don't have time to fart.
We're losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. In three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. We are fucking dead.
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
They're gone.
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Understood.
That's enough!
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Captain, we got a problem.
Now what?
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
What is it, Smith?
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Come again, Skipper?
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
No, no, we just got her back together...
Get out of there now!
Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Justin?
Let's go.
I just finished drying...
Come around to three-three-four...
Radiation interference?
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
Keep your eyes open.
We're all here.
Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
How much oh-two do we have?
Oxygen is not the problem.
Carbon dioxide?
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
What about the life readings you picked up?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
What's causing the readings?
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
Do it. Dr. Weir...
No. It was someone else.
Who?
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
What is it, Starck?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
I've got a theory.
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
I know that.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
Nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
What's going on in there, Starck?
Justin's in the airlock.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Stay here! Don't stop working!
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Five seconds.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
No. I'll be right back.
...repeat, we're armed...
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
He's dead...
He's been past Mars?
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
They're explosive charges.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
Can you see a body?
There's no one here.
I did.
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
Not according to the computer.
Can you shut it down?
Keep him talking.
Do you know what it was?
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
It's cold.
I don't care.
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
She's not ugly.
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
We're losing atmosphere...
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
Matching speed... now. Range to target ten thousand meters and closing... Skipper, I got a bad feeling about this...
Range 3000 meters and closing.
1000 meters...
Explosive decompression.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
Get them back --
I'm trying, goddammit --
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
How?
Well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with Weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
Do they have pressure?
Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis.
Ship's log.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
Claire is your wife?
Yes.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
It wants me. I have to go.
I'm alright. Please.
The forward airlock.
Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock?
It means nothing.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Relax, it's casual.
No, I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
I like the sound of that.
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
I mean...
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Victor did.
Is it safe?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Oh, he did.
What did he do to the uniform?!
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
It's easy for you to be patient.
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Victor must've taken him.
I'm worried about you.
About me? How sweet.
What is this? Where's Reed?
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
And you can? Power it up?
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Baby, you're scaring me.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
You'd never know it.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
Youthful high spirits.
Five times.
I had it at four.
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
Victor's better at these things.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Solid.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Well maybe you should date him.
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Ben. Are you okay?
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Yeah, nine years straight.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
We're working as hard as we can --
Got it, teach.
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Reed?... Sue?
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Give me a mirror...
Go back to the drawing board.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way, wide load coming through.
And they're changing into...
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What do you mean "complete"?
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
That's terrible news...
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
I though we went over this.
Not this again --
No: You're ON FIRE!
What about you?
Ben! Ben!
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
Ben, are you there?
You've been working out.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Oh, it is.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
I can go hotter!
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
They're not costumes.
Right, whatever, have fun.
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Now.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Please tell me you go silent too.
Johnny.
Okay, "mom."
I think that thing is Ben.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Sweet.
That's the temperature of the sun.
Girl...?!
Dude. That's my sister.
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Blockhead started it!
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
And if he's not...?
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Showtime.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Then what is it?
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
And that's a good thing?
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Front page?
Never better.
I was talking about us. Working together.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Great minds think alike.
Yes, thanks.
That's good. That's uh... good.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Passion.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
Sue... look at your hands.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
We need to get past them.
What...?  Oh.
That's what we're here to find out.
If it happened to him, then it could...
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Excuse me?
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sure I can come up with something.
What in the world would give me that idea?
Are you kidding?
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
I think it was a little more complicated than --
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
And reverse the mutations --
Curing countless diseases, not just ours.
Of course. Of course.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
You were?
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
I gave him twenty.
Why didn't you say something?
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
You need a doctor.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
Not at all.
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
Hilarious.
Sure.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Ben's still out there --
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Ben did this.
Ben did this?
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I understand the business reasons.
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Raising the shields.
You can't leave them out there.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Susan. What are you doing?
Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Oh, I think you already have.
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Skeptical...?
Arnold. What's happening?
You want to work at Carl's?
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
All right!!
Of course.
How much did they cost?
Don't worry about it.
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
Totally.
It's the first door on your left.
It's the first door on your left!
On the ledge?
First door on your left!
There it is!
Later.
This is how I dress all the time.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
No. I want my money back right now.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Manager!!
Sis.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Hey-yo.
Why can't you do it?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Your friends use the pool too.
I take out the garbage.
Don't strain yourself.
They're not home yet.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I'll explain everything later.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Where did you hear that?
I'm just guessing.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Why?
I don't know. I was just curious.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
You are a virgin!
But your face did!
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
No.
All right, then. It's your secret.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
They were left over from the last shift.
Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
But they weren't mine.
Okay, Dennis.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Yes, sir.
You're fired.
Ugh.
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Leave me alone.
Dad says!
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Oh, really?
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Get a ride with somebody.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
What a guy.
Mark is a really nice boy...
I don't know.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I know what I look like.
Well...
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Come on...
He's my friend, too.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
No. Are you crazy?
You first.
How about both of us at the same time?
Let's continue.
What? Are you all right?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I guess I did.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Hello.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
What? Now?
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
I know it's yours.
All right, I take it back.
We've got to get an abortion?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Get going.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
It's definitely your mama.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
She's in my biology class.
Did you get her number?
Did you get her name?
No. It's too soon.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
I would. Yeah.
Really?
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
Yeah?
Ace the jacket.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
All right. Pay attention.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
Damone. It's Mark.
Mark. What happened to your date?
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Did you go home and get it?
I'm really pretty busy...
Damone! You come here?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Okay. See ya.
Really.
No Damone. I don't understand.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Fine. Get lost.
Whatever you say, Rat.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
Yes.
I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
And they don't call my parents?
Not if you're over sixteen.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I've been swimming, Merv.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
I don't go at all.
Fascinating.
That's me, Merv.
Totally.
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
I thought he was out of town.
He is.
Then don't hassle it.
Naw. Any good?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
All right.
I like sex.
This ain't no cop.
They're fuckin' with us.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Just be glad you're all right.
My brother is gonna shit.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
Do you think that guy's cute?
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
What should I do?
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
Should we buy a frame for that?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
So what did you do?
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
I can't do that.
Really?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
He was hot, wasn't he?
If I didn't have a fianc� in Chicago, I'd go for it.
Believe it.
No way! He just called him a dick.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
What variables?
What's the big deal?
Well I never did it.
There's nothing to it.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
It was okay.
It was nice.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Hey! That's my line!
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Not since November.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Sixteen.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
Climax together.
Does that ever happen?
No. But it's a nice idea.
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
No.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
What do you think it is?
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
What?
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
That little prick.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
That little prick.
I paid for it and everything.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
What do you want?
I want romance.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Sometime?
Yeah, like maybe never.
But what are you going to do?
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Dartmouth?!
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Really?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
That's the name they gave me.
Yes.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
I don't know. I guess so.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
If you graduate.
All right! Oh, yeah!
Aloha, Spicoli.
I know, everyone says that.
How about your phone number?
No problem.
Thanks. So do you.
Where do you feel like going?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
How about the point?
The point sounds fine.
All right, the point it is.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
What about those other guys you live with?
No. I mean back to your home.
Yes.
We keep them.
You keep them.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Oh... yes.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I've heard that, too.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Excellent.
Oh yeah.
Two more Cokes.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Aren't your parents asleep?
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
No. That's okay.
Naw. I don't mind.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Sure.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Well... it's getting kind of late.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham?
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
Oh. I see.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
What about the notes?
I'll get you the notes.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
I'd like that.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
Anything to drink?
Two Cokes.
Okay. Thanks.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Yes... It makes sense.
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Awake? What do you mean?
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Not for me.
Righto!
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Well, thank you.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Holy shit!
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Tell me. What do you want?
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
Not where we operate.
Naked.
WHAT?
Dobermans don't talk.
What?
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Naw!
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
Not down in my parts.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
And nobody did anything?
A major!
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
Naw! Not a major.
He wanted the pineal gland.
Really?
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
What do you mean by that?
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
This is my granddaughter...
Don't worry...  ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.  Just another good American like yourself.
Hell, no!
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
What?
Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
Jesus! Did I say that?
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
Damn right!
My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.
The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
You whore!
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
Lacerda?
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
No, no. Don't leave me!
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
Why what?
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Not much. Why?
I have to go.
GO?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
Can we make it?
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
I want to leave fast.
Do they pay you to screw that bear?
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
What for?
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
He told me he was turning in early...
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
What tape?
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
How about a check?
Whatever's right.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Jesus.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Are you ready?
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
The cops?
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
Plans?
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
NO! Stop talking like that.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Us?
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Like big lizards.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Lucy is looking for you.
No, she's looking for you.
She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
It's gone too far.
Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid."
Where'd you get this?
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
Some of what?
Extract of pineal!
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Yes!
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Do you think you can handle it?
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.
Never missed a plane yet.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
Nobody. I'm the maid!
I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
No! I swear I'm not!
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
Alice. Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
I fear nothing.
Of course, officer.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
That's a strange attitude.
A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Part of what?
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
You and a lot of other people.
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people.
Spare me.
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
We can't risk letting them in.
Right.
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
They'll be back.
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
We're going to get my little girl.
Where is everyone?
I don't know, I just got here. Did you find your girl?
Yeah.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Nah, I got the gun.
Her fella.
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
With what just happened upstairs --
Gonna stay for a couple?
Who the hell would you call?
Anyone.
We're lucky to be alive.
C'mon guys--
Where's that?
Come on, come on.
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
You gotta be with me on this.
And the rest of 'em?
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
And the head?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Well, justice is funny.
Hey!
Easy.
There's a tunnel.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
In the corner, behind the curtain.
Shit!
Just move!
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
Fuck you too.
Get in line!
No. You?
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
The door... on three.
What?
Just an observation.
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Why don't you go check it out?
Fuck no.
You weren't helpin'.
Go douche.
Oh yeah?
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
Who's with me?
He's dead.
My truck.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Your brother, huh?
Yep.
Your parents of relation?
Anyone else?
We gotta try.
Anybody else?
What?
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
What's in the back?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
But not flush against the tunnel?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Well...
Oh.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
Oh, no.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Really?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Will I go crazy or something?
Why not then?
But --
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Okay then.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
The girl's got rhythm.
Sure.
How much you got?
How much I got, what?
You don't understand sweety, Daddy doesn't pay, Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
What?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
He only shot you once.
Huh?
He shot you the other time.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
What?
What do you mean what?
Huh?
Nothing.
Is it gassed up?
Fully.
Four door?
Two.
Open?
Covered.
How many?
Holds four.
Max?
Seven.
Nine?
Keys.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
Get outta here.
Oh? And what's that?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
F-f-fuck you.
You smell like ass!
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
No bullshit.
What the hell's going on here!?
Clear!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Duh hickey.
Gimme the keys.
NO, but I will lock you in.
What?
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Move slow and move quiet.
No shit.
You keep that key handy.
I'm fine! I'm fine!
If he doesn't shut up...
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
MOVE YOUR ASS!
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Get something on that.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
I'm sure.
BONSAI!
Amazing you made it this far.
Am I too heavy for you?
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
HELLLPPP!
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Ok. Let's see what happens.
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Nothing, just lookin'.
YOU'LL HIT US!
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
And the last one is the...
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
That's fine.
Whoa!
Wait God-dammit!
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
Not without you!!!
Go!!!
That's one piece of four problems.
Stop her!
Let's lock off this room.
All right.
I'm fine, I really am.
I admire your strength.
We all have to be strong, right?
Right.
Oh...
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
I'll do anything to help.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Deal.
I'd love to.
I think --
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Um, well...
Are you lying to me?
Well...
What did we say about lying?
I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
What're you doing?
Putting on my armor.
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
'Forgive'...? For What?
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Excuse me, sir?
I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
I guess so, sir.
Very fine bone structure.
You see: We've got to change that name.
Thank you --
I intend to make a great deal of money off you.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
Never mind that. I'm concerned about you. Your attitude.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
No, I'm concerned with everything.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
I'd like nothing better.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
My clothes?
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
You know what I mean.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
...acts. I'll relay your message.
You're afraid!
I'm not!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
What?
Thank you.
Huh.
Come here. I want to show you something.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Who is she?
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
Frances.
Where's Clifford?
He's not here.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
Who?
An actress.
A rich actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
What does Clifford say?
Right now we have to be practical.
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
He knows, Frances.
In my eyes, officer.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
I didn't make the law, lady. I just enforce it.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Get your clothes on, lady --
GET OUT!
You're under arrest.
Sort of.
There've been some calls.
Who?
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
Fired?
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
...Yes.
Without me.
Showdown.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Dick, we need some time apart --
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dick...
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
No?
What night?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
All square, Doc.
Good. 'Cause I don't want to see you again.
I know you believe that.
...Don't you?
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
We'll get you home, Frances.
Thank you, Harry.
But I'll never win that.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Really?
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Thank you.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
No.
Were you a drug addict?
No. Never.
Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel!
See you next weekend, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
I didn't have much to do with it.
You wrote it, didn't you?
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
He's a socialist, then?
I know.
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
You really want to go?
Of course.
And you think it's worth all this?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
...Then go.
Be careful, Francie.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Always. Always.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
I love you too, Francie.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
Please, Francie...
Daddy!
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
Thank you.
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
Good.
See you next weekend?
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
But, Kurt, I...
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Oh, Kurt!
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Fifteen.
Address?
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
You can always come see it in London.
Only if you were in it. Are you?
I wouldn't miss it.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Are you really serious? About acting?
Why... yes.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
You sound as if you hate it.
No, I don't hate it.
...Not if I can help it.
They'll mend.
What about your husband?
What is this?
Why, you... you little bastard!
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Not me. But other people seem to.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Yeah, well --
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Whattaya mean?
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Harry.
Harry.
You think I'd miss it?
How'd I look?
Enh.
Don't be a rat, Harry.
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Quietly.
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
What happened to him?
He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines.
...So you think I should go.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
You don't know what you want.
Yeah.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Came to get a tan.
Kaminski.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
What?
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Oh no...
Eight stories.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Harry... I met someone.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Yeah.
Hey that's great, Farmer, just great.
Is that why you did it?
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
You're telling me.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Forget it.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
No, they don't, do they?
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
The hell you will, Harry York.
Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
I know.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Calm down, Frances.
Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
Frances...
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
What's left of my blood.
Think I'll have a glass.
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
What for?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
I took the early rounds.
I'll bet.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Beats me.
No, Harry, I can't --
You're coming.
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
Who said I was a lady?
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
I should've known...
What?
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
That's right.
...Take advantage of me.
Whattaya think you're in now?
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Huh?
A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
I guess.
What's that?
You can't drink.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
What a man!
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Huh?
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
Will you marry me?
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Frances, You're crazy.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
I love you too, Frances.
Oh Harry...
Yeah. I don't know.
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
I don't know.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
I hope so, Frances.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
How did I look?
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Well... you're looking well.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Why do you say that?
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
I'm not sure.
No.
No, we're not.
Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
That would be okay.
Just a little way.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
And no people.
Yes.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
Fine!
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
Who're you?
I live here.
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
What?
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
'Golden Boy.'
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
But I want to. I'm trying!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
Your big speech?
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
I already have.
The speech? Real good.
You think I got it?
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Yes, Ma.
And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
...You will.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Mama, what's...
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
You're taking me home!
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Why are these all opened?
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
Then why did you bring them?
It's your fan mail, little sister.
You kill me, Mama.
What?
Go on...
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Not long.
I'll be back.
Sure.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
Yes, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Yes, Mama.
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
Mama...?
They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
No!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Mama, shut up!
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
I'm going out!
You're not going anywhere!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Frances!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
I will, I promise.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
I have!
But what --
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready.
Excuse me.
Yes...?
Don't I know you?
I don't believe so.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
Oh bullshit.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
It ain't for lack of trying.
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which...
Please sit down...
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
I see.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Normal. Average.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
...Did you really say that?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
Stay calm, please.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Really? Any problems?
You're telling me you feel guilty.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Oh for Christ's...
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
You what?
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Huh?
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
Frances, I'm warning you...
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
Sedate her.
No!
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
No!
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
No! No!
Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
Yeah?
I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
You're kidding.
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
What?
'Incurable.'
Yes.
I was watching.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
You drove him to his torment.
And he drove me to mine.
Then why weep for him?
Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
What kindness?
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
The music? Or the fire?
Better that way... for me.
Why?
It can't be as bad as that.
Worse.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Yes. Very close
Why do you not go to them?
I am afraid.
You speak.
How did you find me?
Kill me and have done with it.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
I see it before me.
I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
Materials. Nothing more.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
I don't know.
Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
There is something I want.  A friend.
Friend?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
And if I consent?
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
Her body pleases me.
A brain. Extremities.
This was not taken from a grave.
I will not! Kill me now!
That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
She's not for you.
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper suitor.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
There, there... shhh...
Quite right!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
And you look so lovely.
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
It's been months. It's not like him.
So have I
I should go. I should leave today.
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
Fine.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
Is he not back yet?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Aren't you?
Nothing can. Not ever.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
God took her from us.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
The world is a dizzying place.
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Father's so proud.
And you?
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
All my life I've known.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I wish to be your husband.
I wish to be your wife.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
Only you.
I will be here when you return.
Your decision. For us.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
Victor. I love you,
Elizabeth. My more than sister.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I've no choice
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
So do I.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
Why the change? What about your work?
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
It is
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
I do. But you must trust me for now.
Now husband and wife.
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Open this door for no-one!
It wouldn't dare.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Aye, Captain.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
No. But someday.
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
Oh God.
Very well then.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
I know. You have a way of making an impression.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
Can you think of a better reason?
Quite a few.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
It's a letter to my father.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Somebody has to!
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
They'll hang him all the same.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
You can't. Death is God's will!
I resent God's monopoly.
That's blasphemy!
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
I've been preoccupied.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
How much longer?
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Yes? And?
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
A... week?
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Is that your diagnosis?
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
You've been going round-the-clock?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
No. They don't.
Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
Thank you, Henry.
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
I owe you that. Done.
Let it go.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
I have no knowledge of that.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Philosophical?
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Despite the lack of challenge.
Victor, explain yourself.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Why?
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
I'm... dying.
Are you a physician?
How is it you come to be here?
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Ah. An explorer.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
I heard.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You know of it?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
Madness?
Who are you?
My name is Frankenstein...
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
No, no, they're all dead...
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
I will protect you.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Tomorrow is another day.
Right! Right!
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
I guess...
Good night, Brenda.
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You want to leave?
You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
Thanks, Alice.
I finished the boats.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Un-hunh.
You okay?
Artist.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
I don't know.
Almost five.
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Good point.
Well, it hasn't been that long.
Absolutely.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
It sounded like Brenda.
I'll go take a look.
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
They're off now.
Okay.
Marcie?
Hey, guys!
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
Wet. I don't know.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
You're welcome.
I meant everything.
I can't, Barry...
Oh, you...
Somebody'll see.
No, they won't...
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Let's go back, Barry...
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where'd you get that stuff?
For sure.
Here we go.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I had to.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
A short somewhere.
Is it stuck?
Get behind him more.
I'll spot you five points.
Where's Ned?
I don't believe you...
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
God, but I love that sexy talk.
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
That was the telephone.
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Good call.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I love you.
I love you.
I don't love Neddy.
Ned!
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
I guess...
You? The brick?
I call it my shower dream.
Lead the way!
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
Mmmmmmmph.
Best over...
Umhummmmph.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Whassamatta?
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
There you are dead wrong.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Okay, Fireman.
Rocky Road.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
Those things can be nasty.
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
I got to.
Aw.
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
How much do I owe you?
I mean...
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
For two lonely nights.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Why not?
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Sure.
Another coincidence.
Yeah.
Just my son and I.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
You said it was just you and your son.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.
Have you ever been there before?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
Twenty-eight.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
I said new, this is an '90.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
So do I just follow you?
Yeah, follow us.
So let's do it.
Vamanos!
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
The truth hurts.
I'm exhausted.
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us into Mexico.
I have no idea.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
What about Kate?
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
I'm running the show. I make the plays, and you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to "go for it." I need your cover. Cover my ass.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
Thank you, son.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
Jacob.
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on the bed. Make a wrong move and I'll shoot you in the face.
He's my son.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
What's this about, money?
It's about money, all right, but not yours. You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need your assistance.
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
On the dresser.
Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.
Come again?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Sorry, I need everybody.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
Scott and Kate.
My wife.
Where is the little lady?
In heaven.
Yes, she is.
How'd she die?
Auto wreck.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Died instantly?
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Yes, they do.
Yes.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Real McCoy.
You're a preacher?
I was a minister.
Was? As in not anymore?
Yes.
Why'd ya quit?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Yes.
Didn't like it, did ya?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
You won't let him touch her?
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
You best better get it done, Pops.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Pops, when you're right, you're right, and you are right.
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Pass.
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Suit yourself, more for me.  Scotty?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
He backed down.
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
To yours.
Forever together.
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
In the Winnebago.
In other words, no.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
Yep.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Amen.
Kate, Scott?
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Ain't it the truth.
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
That happens, you'll get it back.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
What do you think Mom would say?
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
It's a flop house.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Scott?
Not good enough, swear to God.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
No!
Everybody goes home!
We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
Sure.
Mexico.
What's in Mexico?
Mexicans.
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
Do what?
What you said to me in the room.
What did I say?
You asked me if I would --
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Yes.
Do you believe me?
Yes.
You damn well better. Go.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Yeah, we got a bible.
Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.
Okay.
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
I'm really sorry.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
Daddy's dead.
Noooo!
Anytime.
Not many.
Well, when you run out of weapons, just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
Me too.
Later.
-- you got your microwave --
-- you got your sink --
-- you got your shower --
-- see this, television!
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
I would say that's a very safe assumption.
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Not even for lunch?
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
Whatsamatter?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
Knock yourself out.
Six-fifty.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
I wasn't scratching!
Well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! Richie!
You can't come in here.
What dya mean?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
He signaled the Ranger.
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
You believe me don't cha?
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
One... Two... Three.
What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
He didn't recognize shit.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
No.
Do they have a waterbed?
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
All I'm saying --
-- This conversation is over.
Sight seein'.
What'd ya see?
Cops.
Didya look at the border?
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
How do you know?
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
What?
She's in the other room.
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
What?
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Seth, if you were me --
Yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
What does that mean?
What?
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
You meant that, but you meant the other, too.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Keep your voice down.
Or what?
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
I don't know, you just passed out.
I did?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Really?
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
We are?
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
They broke when you fell.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
I'm lookin' scared?
That's what you look like.
You know what you look like?
No, Richie, what do I look like?
You're lookin' green.
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
I'm here with you.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
My shit is together.
It don't look together.
Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.
Yeah.
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Okay, I'll have one.
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
He needs our help!
He's beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can't help him. I've got no one left to lose but you. I can't be alone again. We're sticking together.
Thank you, ensign.
No problem, lieutenant.
That's what I hear.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Who's "we"?
Just some of the women.
I've been accused of that wish.
The woman I saw you with...
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
But are there... I mean, how many...
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Don't say my name.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking...
What'd you find, Kathy?
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
Your prerogative, Senator.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Standing right here in my office.
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Of course, but there's more --
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
I'm fine, sir.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Thank you, sir.  But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Really, I have no problem with --
I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
None at this time, sir.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Didn't take long.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
Oh, really.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Pardon?
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
No, sir, WHAT?
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
So I'll get a fair shot?
You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get.
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
I'm not sure what --
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Sir?  What did he say?
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
Motherachrist...
No problem, sir!
Entering my scan now...
West?
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
Fuck me.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
I'll act surprised.
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
Did you hear?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.
California.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Uh, question, ma'am.
Yes, dear.
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Uh, ma'am.
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Sounds familiar.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Absolutely not.
What changed?
Should probably ask him that.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
You don't know that.
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
I'm sure it is.
You'll think about my offer?
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
Then I suggest we start there.
Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
"G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Do that.
'Snot me.  It's him.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
I can make this wall without --
... two... one... MARK!
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
Come on, Montgomery...
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
Sir?
You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
Get it up!
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
I oughtta report you.
I think you probably would -- if you didn't know I was right.
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
I'll try anyway, sir.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Chances of recovery?
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Blank faces here, O'Neil.
Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle.
Is this my glory, sir?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
So dump on me.
This has nothing to do with you.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Which is guy-speak for...
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
How hard they making it on you?
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
Me?  Why me?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I saw an article...
I can't walk two blocks in Washington without hearing about "G.I. Jane."  You're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
No shortage of suspects.
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
What about him.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
I don't know, I don't care.
What?
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Which is guy-speak for...
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
Well, now I feel so much better.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
And how do you know that?
Made it to Week 10 last time.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
You're kind of a surprise yourself.
Thanks, Wick.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
If you got a good one, Wick...
They had to kill 'em?
That's a good story.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
He was married?
At first.
You got anybody, Wick?
Not me.  You?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Last time I didn't.
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
Sure, sure.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
This is insane.  You've got no proof.
Just askin'
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
I don't know...
Mighta been civilian.
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
Smoke it!
Maybe half.  Not even.
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
You heard me.  Move on.
Educate her, Pyro.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
"Dad."
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Should I be afraid?
Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
That's not right.
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
I think you're the liar.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil?
I'm so glad we agree.
Sure.  Just like your men do.
I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Say again?  How many micks?
15, sir.
Show us where you are, Chief.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Your new roommate.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
Funny, the C.O. says I can.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
North?
MOVE!
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
We are so fucked.
So am I.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
This ain't even workin' wrong!
O'Neil, Jordan.
Thought you two were file-closed.
You knew about us?
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
The first female President?
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
Women.
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
I don't know.  Seems...
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook.  but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it.  A man-in-place.  Makes everything very controllable.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Big bites.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Where's Audrey?
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Me!? You where the one...
Go in there. Talk to her.
You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
Nearly four years...
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
We know, Audrey.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
You made a mistake.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Only one way to find out.
Oh yes he will.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
The JFK? In the rain!?
But we can get to the west side faster.
No.
It's good to see you, Nick.
What?
Yeah, well...
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
Most people don't.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
Sure. I'd like that.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
And you think this creature is one of them?
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
What else do you know about it?
Are you sure?
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
Nesting?
Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
You never said it was off the record.
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
I was wrong.
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
How do you know?
Our network covers the Ranger games.
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Oh my God! They're coming!
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
You'd be surprised.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Speak of the devil.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Who is he?
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
That's the problem. He did.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Your old sweetheart?
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it.
What's it to you?
Can I use some?
What do I get?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Five bucks.
You're kidding, right?
This is not the place...
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
And you're beautiful...
Mr. Caiman...
Call me Charlie.
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
So have dinner with me tonight.
I can't.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Not now. You got my bag?
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
We? I don't think so.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Oh, I'm not married.
Really? A girlfriend then?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Well, I think you're cute.
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
Me too.
I'll try.
Allez, allez!
That is when we will go in.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
They didn't make it.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
And how should we do that, Sir?
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
You're fast.
That is our job.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Get your people out of there or I will.
It's Tatopoulos.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Follow me.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
We know.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
You're standing on it.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
What are you suggesting?
When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
But you don't know for sure!
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
You don't have the authority to do that.
Thanks.
We've met before.
Sounds like a big company.
Are you sure? How do you know?
We know.
Why are you telling this to me?
I need you to trust me.
Why do you need that?
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
We, have already taken care of them.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
Sure.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
So you're in?
Makes us look more American.
You were right.
Good idea.
Where are you?
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Wait.  Au revoir.
Well good, that's very... nice.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
Where's my bed?
Is that the bathroom?
Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
Thanks.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
Open.
I'm... I'm shot.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
I won't and nothing you say-
"The show must go on."
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
Leadership....
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
Like throwing gasoline on a fire...
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Like YOU know?
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
THIS much.
Must be some sort of mining facility.
Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly-
Nothing.
I heard something. A squeal.
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
Shut up.' Just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
I had the shot...
Yes. Good was done this .....
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
Jason, what have you gotten us into?
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
Shut up.
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
You have a better plan, Alex?
The guy is terminally selfish!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Oh can't I? Watch me!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
You could order something in.
A boy comes to the door.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer!
The ships are gaining...
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Alex? Where are you going?
To see if there's a pub.
Could they be the miners?
Nobody was WATCHING?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
What?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
No I didn't.
Yes you did.
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
He probably... Has some very important business to attend to...
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
Oh.  Okay.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Excuse me guys.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
Yes but, we were wondering-
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
What's  your name, son?
Brandon.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
Okay...  Okay, now what.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
Okay, that's where you want to be.
Yes Commander?
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
What do you mean?
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
But you don't?
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
How did you come to that conclusion?
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit.
Okay, now. But-
Wait two seconds then go.
Lt. Madison, GO.
GO Commander.
Up.
What?  Up?
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
That's It?
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
What's the weather like outside?
I never get tired of that joke.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
The enemy is matching velocity.
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
It's fractured...
We need another one.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
All systems are working, Commander.
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
... What does that mean?
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
Covalent... Right. So...
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
OK!
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Never mind, Fred....
No, no... I'll think on it...
Right.
I'll take my chances with Gorignak.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
It's suicide.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
You... know us?
It's ... incredible.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
All right. Put me back on with him.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
Your last name.
Yeah, what is it?
It's... I don't know.
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
We're doing episode 31?
Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
Where'd they go? Back inside?
Not a clue. You?
I think he just likes pointing at things.
We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Oh come on, it's not like I haven't-
But I'm the Commander!
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
JASON...
You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
Computer, can it be repaired?
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
I could have held on to YOU! ...
Don't be ridiculous.
It helps.
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Nothing. Hold please.
Turn on the translation circuit.
What the hell are you talking about?
Right.
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
Gwen...
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Because it was on the show!
Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
Mark 12.
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!"
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Closer?  I can try.
What are you doing? What are thev doino? ~7C INT. SARRIS' SHIP	h37C
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Better than my Lieutenant.  He failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped on our last encounter.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
You have ten seconds.
All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
I don't know.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Simpler.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
I... certainly, but-
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
As you wish.
You... You mean Earth?
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Theramin.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
But what if Sarris survives?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
... Maintenance facility...
NO, Thank God he has not.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Former Commander?
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
Well... Sort of...
We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris.
But there it is!...
A model, only as big as this.
But... Inside, I have seen-
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
But...Why?
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
You can oc that?
I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
And determination.
Wh... Where are we?
Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  I can show you on a map.
I think we're going to exit the space port.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO!
It's as far as it goes!
Oh god...
What kind of signal?
Anything.
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
Tommy, we have these...
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
How about the pig-lizard?
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
It doesn't have eyes.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Find them.
Get oacK on their tail.
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
They always say that.
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
I wish she was beneath me.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Over three hundred miles.
You seem pleased by the prospect.
Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
And a French alliance?
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
Is that a fact.
It is.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
The army can survive without me.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
I?  You all know my history.
While they're strung out?
Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
Same old story.
That can't be.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
You go too far, Benedict.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Well... I misunderstood, then.
A lot of years have gone by.
What?  What are you talking about?
That you would have known you can trust me.
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Yes, general?
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
Yes, general.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
No.  I guess.
You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work.  You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want...
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
No, my lord.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
Yes, my lord.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
Lafayette will not be happy...
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!
Marquis!  Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
We've got powder but no ball!
Then use rocks!
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
Therefore, retreat.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
But it's what he said, just before they killed him:  "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country."
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
To learn to shoot cannon?
We better, Congress invented him.
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
No one knows...
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Yes, I believe so.
Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.
I'm not sure.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
Who's in command out there?
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Lafayette is a child!
Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
They are... friends of Congress.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler!  He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition.  Now, you listen to me:  we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight!  What have we been struggling for all these years?  For this moment!  And, if we fail now, remember:  you stopped us!
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Gag on your own invention, then.
Oh, come now...
You invented this, this...
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
General Lee is detained captain...
Detained by what?
The British army, sir!
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Unofficially, General Greene.
What's the difference?
Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...
A fleet?
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
I understand, George.
George!  So good to be back!
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
I mean, I'm a Deist.  A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin.  Surely you knew that.
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
They help me understand why we fight.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
The man is a traitor!
Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold!  The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain!  Who carried the day at Saratoga!  Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach!  You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs!
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.
What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
Uh... none just now, but...
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
You must be very rich.
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
I only meant...
These supplies...?
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
And how rusty are these muskets?
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
I rode here, on my horse.
Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
General Lee, sir!
Get these men back in line!
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Surely you knew this was coming.
War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
You're no fool, George.  You never have been.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
I think I heard that.
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
What else?  From Virginia?
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
To win this war I need an army.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Some things must never change.
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Our 'kind'?  What is that supposed to mean?  These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight!  They desire it!  They seek it!  Of course Virginia is terrified!  For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!?  It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too!
Martha!  For God's sake!
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
I want you to see our hospital.
I don't want to see your hospital.
We're leaving them?
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
Yessir!
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
It is; we need you George.
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
Is that the truth?  Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
But not more than your comfort.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
That's a lie!
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
I'd throw everything away for you.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
George, I'm sorry.
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Hear that, George?  Sally's actually taken to thinking of this clod of earth as her home.  And it's her first tour.  We're gratified, aren't we George?
Words, words, words!  Sally has been tutoring George in the philosophies, isn't that right?
Africa, of course.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
Or, 'civilized'.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
It's stupid, of course.
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
I think America suits you.
It's the freest land on earth.
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Well, we must be who we must be...
What else should I become?  There's no difference between Virginia and England.  I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society.  My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes.  Everyone laughs at me.
I think I will disappoint you.
Let's get you darker!
You're out of your mind!
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
They can use their imaginations.
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
And dost thou live to ask it?
That's good... who?
Voltaire, of course...
That land belongs to the strongest.
Just because they are born?
Yes!
Who says so?
I say!
I see...
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
Juba was a Numidian.
He was not black!  He was... tan! Weathered!
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
I reserved a Cadillac.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You're kidding me, right?
Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
So where's the money?
You guess? You mean you don't know?
I mean I don't care.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Who?
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Come here, Farrah...
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
What about him?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
No. What's this?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
The money. Fuck. I gotta think...
Calm down, Bear...
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
We'll get it later.
You're right.
So you didn't have the key with you.
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
You spotted them, huh?
I have to ask you for that key.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
Not too bad.
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
About sixty.
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Your who?
Yayo. Where is he?
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
You gave him the money?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
He's around someplace.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
Harry, let me answer that.
You can talk to me.
That's what I thought. So let me put it this way...
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
That's right, me.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole.  So whatta you think of the script?
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
What about her?
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
She's... young.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
That's all there is to it, huh?
That's all.
What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
Tell you what...
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
Three.
She can't talk right now.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
I'll find it.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Gimme an hour.
In the can. That the money?
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
What?
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
Bear, you're not really gonna �-
I can't do it.
It's a different kind of deal.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
I'm working on a few things.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Boy, this town. Word gets around, doesn't it?
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
You serious?
All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
Leo, I don't know.
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
The airport.
It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
That's the magic number.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Yeah, where've you been? We haven't heard from you lately.
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
Who is this?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
What three hundred grand?
The three hundred grand a guy named Leo Devoe scammed off an airline. The three hundred grand Chili Palmer now has in his possession.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Never heard of him.
Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
Or else what?
Or else use your fucking imagination.
Ray. Look at me.
Look at me, Ray.
You say look at you?
That's correct. Look at me.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
Yeah? Which terminal?
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
I like it here.
Whatever you want, Ray.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
What, like that's supposed to mean something to me?
He owes me money.
Get in line, bro.
I don't like waiting.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.
You're an investor, is that it?
I'm a producer.
You have a card in here?
Not yet. I just started.
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Something shouldn't be there.
Why don't you get the attendant to open all the lockers and take a look. Maybe you'll find it.
That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
Get him out've here.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
What've you got?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
Where you been, Harry?
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
That's what I'm doing.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
We're there, Harry. You signed markers for a hundred and a half, you're over sixty days past due and you haven't told anybody what the problem is.
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
I know what a marker is.
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
I want you to.
Fuckin' basketball game.
I produce feature motion pictures, no TV. You mentioned Grotesque, that happened to be Grotesque Part II that Karen Flores was in. She starred in all three of my Slime Creatures releases you might have seen.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
The shylock's the good guy.
The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
You mean, Leo?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
But you work for the casino?
So you don't work for the casino?
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
They always paid.
Not really.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Ever shot anybody.
Once.
Really? You ever been arrested?
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
For a movie?
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
What's it called?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
Who's the star?
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
One of his best parts.
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
So what's the problem?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
He drown?
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Just a thought.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You don't even know these guys.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
You're kidding, right?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell 'em something.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
His shrink's trainer.
Hey, Harry.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
Get the fuck outta my chair.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
I found him.
You have it?
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Who?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Tell you what, Harry, tomorrow morning, when the airport's crowded, I'll go check it out. If I don't see a problem, I'll pick up the money...
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
He died.
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
What Get Away jet?
It was in the Herald.
Hey, it's your book now. You want to check it out, go ahead. He's got a dry cleaning business out on Federal Highway.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Ask your man here.
Twenty seven hundred.
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
We talk different?
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
So you want to know.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One of mine?
One we're producing.
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Pressure? I'm the one applied the pressure.
Martin, look at me.
I'm looking at you.
Like this?
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
Wait. How about this?
Now you're squinting like you need glasses.
That's not bad.
I believe it.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Okay. I'm listening.
You're not going to tell me the rest?
Buddy?
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
What's that?
Compass.
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
That's not bad. I think you got it down.
I didn't know where else to keep it.  Where would you?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
They report it to the IRS.
Who told you that?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
How'd you know I was here?
Here's another tip...
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
How? By taking my money?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
It's all mine.
Sit down, Leo.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
I'll find you, Leo...
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
Maybe you don't see my sign?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
You broke in?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
I know what a vig is.
That's right. Three percent.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
A real bargain.
How much is the wife offered?
I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
Rough day on the set?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons �-
Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -� which by the way was a better book than a movie -� did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
For any movie.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Man, can you scream.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
Yeah, you know when Bette comes up to the guy on the porch, gives him a flirty look and says, 'I'd kiss you, but...'
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
Don't go out of your way.
Right. See how your story ends.
I just caught the end.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
What do you think?
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Then you've read it?
Not yet.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
There a part in it for you?
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
Sounds fair.
What do you get out of it?
I want to know.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
Depends, who pays?
Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Really.
You thought I was faking?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Oh.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
What happened?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
You're as bad as Harry...
I'll go. I'll go.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
You bet.
You don't act like it?
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
Go get your stuff.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
Don't say a fuckin' word.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
He already knew it.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I'm thinking about producing.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Get down here. I wanna talk to you. Come on... right now...  She's gonna talk to Martin?
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
She's scared! Fear is an emotion!  Look, kid, if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm, let it be the three key words to filmmaking.
Pick 'n' Save.
You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
What he was, was a hack, couldn't get a job writing for anybody but you.  I'm being honest. He was a lousy writer, but he was a good husband. I just didn't know it until too late.
You seem to feel fine about it.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Murray's dead.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
How honorable of you.
Be quiet and listen.
I don't hear anything.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
I don't have a dog.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
Harry -�
I'm going.
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
That's where you got the idea?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Oh, yeah, sure.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
'We?'
Chili and me.
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Mob guy?
What money?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Shylock?
Hello, Martin.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
But you are interested?
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey �-  This your ride, Chili?
Thanks.
And after all, you have such morals.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
A passenger liner. Over.
Say again. Over.
What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Sixty pounds.
What? You sure?
That's what it says.
Lemme see.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Damn mind of it's own.
Morning, skipper.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
I don't know. Tuesday?
Wrong. It's Friday.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
What?
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
What?
Maureen.
Maureen?
Roger?
Yeah.
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Bring it on, dude.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
Yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
Or uninvited guests.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
What're you crazy?
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
So we kill him?
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Seen a lota movies.
Oh yeah.
A what?
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Then what the hell happened to him?
Right. Wednesday.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Why not?
What?
Get up.
Yeah, yeah.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
Smugglers maybe.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
If you get it back in one piece.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
What is it?
Threw a turbine blade.
How long to fix?
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Like I always say --
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
Hard to say.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
What about running number two by itself?
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
How long, then?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
How long?
Three, four days.
Goddamit, Dodge.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
She take a radio?
What, you think there's something funny about it?
A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
It looks like it.
The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
How about you Epps?
Yeah, yeah.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
Not in the eyes of the law.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Could be meant as a warning.
So whoever did this might still be around.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Right.
Murphy.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
What is it?
Not me.
If they knew what they were carrying.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
What do you propose?
For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
I don't know what you're talking about?
I think you know.
Maybe you can tell me then.
The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
You smashed it!
What?!
Don't lie to me!
What the fuck -- ?
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
Conveniently enough for you.
Look, I didn't touch it. Alright?
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
If money can buy what he wants.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Then you're a lucky man.
Right.
Sorry.
Don't fall asleep.
Right.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
I bet you did.
Too big. More like a freighter.
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Probably didn't have time.
That's what I call a payday.
Hell yeah.
You're a pal.
Because of the gold.
No.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Lights?
Sudden flashes of light.
I feel fine.
Better than starving to death.
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
What?
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Yeah. Thanks.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
She was sailing up north, right?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
Nope.
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
So what did happen?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
You're more practical than superstitious.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Did you see him?
Who?
The guy. He just came this way.
There's somebody else on this boat.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
You sure it wasn't me?
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
No cowboy shit. Right.
Yup.
Epps.
You just shoot at something?
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
Greer?
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
Same. Any luck?
No. I'll try again later.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
Only something must've gone wrong.
What?
But, who -- ?
February first.
The same day she supposedly went down.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Collision? With what?
But where's the damage?
If it was a ship she hit.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep.
Wish I could say the same.
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
The what?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
I don't know, are we?
Not our mystery guest again.
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Showing you what?
What happened.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Victims of what?
That much I think we've already established.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know.
Just lucky I guess.
Epps, over.
Either of you seen Dodge?
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Right here.
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
Over the gold.
Maybe it was more than that.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
We hit land.
What?
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
So you killed them?
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
I think I see it pretty well.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
Go.
Of course they did.
What do you say, Dodge?
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
I must be in the wrong business.
You got that right.
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
Red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Alright. I'll be right up.
Looks like it's adrift.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
How's that?
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
Sorry.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
We've done it before.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
You're up late.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Ho, baby!
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
We could call for help.
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Moving to Sweden.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
And look what happened.
Maybe.
Drink up then.
Lost my sea legs.
You don't remember?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
You've been out for about a day.
Say what?
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
Shut up.
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
A what?
Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
Fine with me.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go.
Or what?
Better late than never.
What's this?
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
No, no. You got leak.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
Guess.
How should I know?
Someone from the past.
Who?
Give up?
Maxine.
Not the Maxine?
Yup.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
What is it now?
I guess.
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
Nothing.
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
What?
Well... as you know, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other, and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the Summer, just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want.
About what?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
I just buzzed him in.
But I can't --
JUST DO IT!
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
No, really I --
Oh, all right... Party-pooper! Just let me put a few things away.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Hello...
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
What are you trying to say?
It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
I see... interesting...
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Did you actually do this painting?
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Uh-oh.
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
...wow...
So what do you think?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Well, yes...
I...
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
What do you mean?
Huh?
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
I didn't check my messages...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
You can count on me, sir!
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Jesus...
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Look, can we talk in a minute? I'm almost done.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
No.
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
I figured something like that...
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
You need counseling.
Hi.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Yeah, well... hi...
Can I come in?
I guess.
Why?
What do you mean "why"?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Yeah, right...
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Then why do you hate me so much?
When did I say I hated you?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
That's just the way I am!
Yeah, well --
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Why do you have that stupid poster?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
How long have you been up?
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Why not?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Okay... I promise.
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
Hey Josh.
Are you ready to go?
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
What?
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Why?
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Shut up!
Uh oh... don't turn around...
Forget it...
I know, she needs to die immediately.
How perfect.
He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
Good.
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
Why?
Just look at them!
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
We should follow them!
In fact, never.
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
That lets us off the hook.
Or maybe not.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Okay, okay!
Hey, look at this...
God, it's so totally pathetic.
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
You loser!
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
What does that even mean?
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
You can have that one.
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
Gross.
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Oh, we totally have to.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
What is this?
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
I've been looking all over for this.
What a little hosebag.
I remember every minute of that party.
There's my dad with Joanie.
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine.  There! Look at her!
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
What are you talking about -- who?
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
Fuck you!
Which loser?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Oh yeah.
Why do I always have to do it?
You're better at it.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
What does it stand for?
Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
She says she wants to MMPH!
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I can't believe it!
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
I dunno...
Totally! Look!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
Come on, it's too late now...
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
Oh yeah...
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Somewhere downtown.
What are you talking about?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Just promise you'll do it.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
Fuck you, bitch!
It's always closed...
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
Let's go hassle Josh.
As always.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
Why don't you ask him.
JOSH!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Should we leave a note?
It'll only take a second.
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
I didn't get it either.
Everybody's too stupid!
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
What? Where?!
It's a surprise.
I don't believe you.
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Wait...
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Where?
Anthony's II!
No way... when?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
You cunt!
He does that every single day.
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
That rules!
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
But those are our people...
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
Like what?
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
He gives me a total boner!
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Get away from me!
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
We were such desperate sluts back then.
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Don't worry.
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
Yeah, thanks.
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Yeah, I guess... call me...
Go ahead...
No, really...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Don't you want nice stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
You're insane.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
What thing?
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
What happened to Seymour?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
How repulsive!
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
What are you talking about? Who?
Just some people from work...
I don't believe you.
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
What? When did you see Josh?!
He came into work.
Nothing.
When was this?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Great...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
I said "great"...
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
I need to talk to you.
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
It's fine.
So where's all your stuff?
That's all you're bringing?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
What time?
I dunno...
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
It just came yesterday...
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Really? Both of you?... Why not?
Just because.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid.
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Nothing.
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
What are you doing here, Melorra?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
Well, we won't keep you.
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
Shhh!
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
Listen, young lady... I know you don't like me -- I don't really care whether you do or not -- but I will not allow you to treat your father the way you do.
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
How much is this?
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
That's okay...
Seymour does.
Who does?
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
It's kind of falling apart.
Where did you get those pants?
Tell me what?
Punk rock is over!
I know it's over, asshole, I --
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
That's not even --
Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
That tape sucked, by the way!
I'm so sorry if you were offended!
Get a job!
Norman.
Yes.
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're late, asshole.
Fine, and how are you?
Did you bring that tape?
I did too!
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
Hey, where are you going?
Later, "Dude".
What?
Five hundred.
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Well why do I care about that?
God, fuck you!
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
Sure, I guess.
Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
Wow!
A dollar seventy-five.
Okay.
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Wow!
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Watch my stuff.
NO!!!
Hey, I was only kidding!
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
Oh, right...
Good luck...
I'm totally serious!
Yeah, well...
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
I really didn't get a good look at her.
Jesus!
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
Every guy has a type!
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
Well are --
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
I - I'd really rather not...
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
I don't think so...
PLEASE? We have to!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
OH MY GOD!
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
C'mon, Seymour, please?
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Jesus, Seymour.
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
Just wait here.
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Jesus...
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Hooray for me.
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
"Yet."
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
What, are you a klansman or something?
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
For nineteen years...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Yeah, but still...
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Hey, can I borrow this?
What? Why?
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Don't you trust me, Seymour?
No, Doofus... blow it out!
Are you okay?
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
What, like a girdle?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Really?
Never...
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Why?
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Who knows?
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
How can you be so sure?
Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
Hi, it's me...
So, what happened?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
What? You're kidding me...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!
Really?
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
Sounds good...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
And you like them?
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
Just someone so young...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I... I don't think so.
Does that mean you don't like me?
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
...What do you mean?
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
I had to see you.
What's up?
Can you at least let me in?
Uh... sure... come in.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What's the matter?
Do you have anything to drink?
What about this?
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
Jesus, how can you stand her?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I hate sports.
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What about Joe?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
Yeah, well I like you too...
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
So where would we go?
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I dunno, I...
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
What do you want?
I-I-I...
What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
I will if you want to.
No... forget it...
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
But, I...
They're Seymour's.
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Right.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
No problem.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I wish I could see him.
Yeah.
Call me sometime.
I am.
Talk to us about it...
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Right, exactly!
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
She's not at home?
No... they said she was here...
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
I don't know.
Why? What did she tell you?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
I have no idea - I just want to...
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Did she say that?
Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
What do you mean?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
What are you talking about?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
Why don't we start with that next week?
Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
Yes?
Do you have a check for me?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Let me see the sick.
There is no reason for fear.
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights.
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
You think you matter?  -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee-
As are they all.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
-now you're telling me my beliefs?- I don't think so-
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
-careful, Abdullah-
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
I think it's been a pleasure.
How; we don't know where they are?
We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
You've never built in Africa.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
Don't they, though?
So work must be going well?
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
Yes he is.
Well, I need to speak to him.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed?
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
And it worked?
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job.
You genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people, don't you? Well, fine-  -except there isn't a higher rated engineer and we both know that. And since time is so important to you, how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here?
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
Very well, the job's still yours, I'll go. But if I have to return, you're finished. And I will then do everything I can to destroy your reputation. Am I not fair?  Told you you'd hate me.
Then why do you stay?
Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift.
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight.
You don't enjoy killing, do you?
Then why do it?
You never had it.
Nigel and I don't like each other much.
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
You intend "sorting this out" tonight?
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
Then we agree.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
-not "what if"- there will be, there always are. Which only means that our "son" and I- note my confidence- will have an excuse to come visit.
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
That is correct.  Nothing.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
I assure you we came close many times-
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
That. I know Robert seems dreadful, but when you truly get to know the man, well, he's much worse.  And I'm one of his defenders.  Forget him for now- it's your first ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it breathtaking.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Does he speak English?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done.
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed!
Shhh.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
That is precisely my plan- but back in my tent.
What?
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
So that's what a lion looks like.
-true enough- but without the comedy relief.
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
Possibly.
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
John, it will not be easy.
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands-
But you said they were always old.
That's what the books say...
-far end of camp- man wandering alone at night. Hawthorne's examining the body now.  There's even less of him than of Singh.
But it's crazy- the lion shouldn't be that hungry this soon.  Samuel?
We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?
What did I do?
Got me out of trouble.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
Actually, no.
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard.
Somehow I guessed.
That's very considerate.
I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
I can try.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you.
Has it ever done that before?
...don't know...
Have you ever failed?
Only in life...
It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
But of course yours worked.
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn...
What happened to them?
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
Don't they have to be?...
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
I'll be bait alone?
Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever.  Can you control your fear?
I'll have to.
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
Was that supposed to make me feel better?
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Good luck.
Why?
Because I think they're after you.
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came.
Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
The workers don't get on?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them.
This is more difficult-
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
Nonsense.
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
Good news?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Do you love her?
I do, actually; very much.
You give me hope, John.
I have to ask- why do you need me?
Oh yes. But it takes time.
You've known him long?
Since his beard was red.
He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
Once...
Underneath.  Somewhere.
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit-
I don't believe you had a mother.
Four should do it.
They will want a lot of money.
Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers-  -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Help finish the railroad.
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Hold your son high.
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Thank you, Janosz.  I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Good night, Janosz.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Everybody has a choice.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I don't care who he is.  He's not taking my baby.
We don't have a relationship.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Oh no.
Occasionally
How is he these days?
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Does he ever mention me?
No.  Not that I can recall.
Certainly.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I won't.
Thank you.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
You're also a human being, Frank.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
Okay, that's no problem.
That's exactly what you said last week.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot.  Let's go to work, boys.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
His name is Oscar.
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
I'll supervise.
We definitely had a moment or two.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Good luck.
Thanks.
Oh, hello, Peter.
You're really good, you know.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
Good-bye, Peter.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
I don't know what to do anymore.
I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub.  You better stay here.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Sounds like another slime job ... No, they're all right.  They're here now ... Right ... Let me know.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Or we could do that.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Does she know anything about babies?
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
I'm not even good for me.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
Let me jingle you right now.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Same difference.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Hi, Egon.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Now you're talking.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
Ghostbusters.
What are you doing up here?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Okay.
You're right.  We should stay.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Too bad for the Moldavians.

Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
My pleasure.
I know.
Then why have you come?
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
The Upper West Side.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
Command me, lord.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
I command you.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Lord Vigo, the mother, Dana, is fine and strong.  I was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if I bring the baby, could I have the woman?
So be it.  On this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
Sorry, your Honor, but when somebody sets me up like that I can't resist.
Who are they?
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
Maybe they just want to appeal.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Do I?
Yes.
Get on with it, counselor!
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
Did I forget something?
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Like what?
You were the one who got me in.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
Well, for your sake, I hope you're right.  But I think my other guest may disagree with you. Elaine, you had another date in mind?
Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
Hello, Venkman.
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I don't even want to know where that is.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
I knew that.
You need the exercise.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
It's a rough translation from the Moldavian.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
From where -- Neptune?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
Good idea.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
What's the reading?
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
And we're the ...
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
We need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
Something good --
Do it!  Just do it!
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
No, the slime is rising.
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Oh, Ray --
Who, Ray?
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
Relax.  We're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I'm Peter --
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
What kind of tests?
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
I'll get one more reading.
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Darn it!  I wish I'd known you were going. I'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
She's new in town.
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
Oh, right, you told me that.  They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall.  How about you, Winston?
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
I'm ready.
Then let's do it.
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
It likes all the sappy stuff: 'Cumbaya,' 'Everything is Beautiful,' 'It's a Small World' -- but it loves Jackie Wilson.
Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."
You finished here?
What?  Yeah.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
No, I just thought --
Well don't think!
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
So we'll put a warning on the label.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
And decent.
Wonder what?
If she's naked under that toga.  She's French, you know.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Well, thanks a lot.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Have I done the right thing?
Uuuuuuugh!!
What's the matter, dear?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
No.  They're just coming to me.
Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Eight o'clock?
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
Hi, Louis.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Are you sick, Louis?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Hi, Louis.
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
I got the Twister game for later ...
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
All right, what happened to me?
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
So what do you think it was?
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
It's in the stars.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
That's a violin concerto.
Yeah, but it's got a great cello break.
Like a used car salesman.
Thanks.  What's in there?
What?
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
I told you, I ...
I know.  It happened by itself.
Are you all right?
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
All right.  What do you want to do?
I think I should spend the night here.
That's it.  Get out.
I want to help you.
I'll scream.
Don't scream.
Then leave.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
All right.
Goodbye.
No kiss?
You heard it?
You're the best one in your row.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Who's the stiff?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Can't you tell me now?
You must have gotten the last copy.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
I've got to go now.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
He is the Destructor.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Take me now.
I want you inside me.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Whoa!! Nice voice.
Really!  Is it gone?
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
Talk to my accountant.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
But why?  The students love us!
I see.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
That would definitely explain it.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
We'll get back to you.
Print is dead.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Is that a game?
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
Die in what sense?
In the physical sense.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
That's so romantic.
What is it?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
I don't believe in luck.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Thank you.
What calls?
Here are tonight's calls.
The EPA?  What's he want?
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
Has this ever happened before?
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
Great!  How's it going?
Are you Peter Venkman?
Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
You could say that.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
I'm not at liberty to say.
In a storage facility.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Yes, it would.
And may I see this storage facility?
No, you may not.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
The magic word is "please."
Why do you want to see it?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
A square?
Good guess -- but no.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
Then my theory was correct.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Wow!
Were you recently in the bathroom?
What on earth gave you that idea?
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
What have you got, Egon?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
I'm always serious.
Wow!
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
Yeah, I can smell it.
Don't cross the beams.
Why not?
Trust me.  It will be bad.
What do you mean "bad?"
It's hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
What is it?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Does she want to be?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
I agree.
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
She said he was "the Destructor."
Who?
Gozer.
You talked to Gozer?
Get a grip on yourself, Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
Life is just a state of mind.
But it's my favorite state.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
I blame myself.
We'd better adjust our streams.
God, it's ugly!
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
Neutronize.  System shut.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I'm worried, Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
That appears to be the case.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
What do you mean by "seen?"
Looked at with your eyes.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
What do we do now?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
What do I say?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
Oh, yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
Ray, I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo, too.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
For what purpose?
To go into business for ourselves.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
Fourteen hundred.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
No sense worrying about it now.
Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Where are you, Pete?
Third floor.  Get down here,
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
It's not good, Pete.
Who was the architect?
I don't think it's Shandor.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
What?  What popped in there?
Look!
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Mmmhmmm.
Me, too.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Do you believe in God?
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
And the seas would boil ...
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
Right.  We'll believe anything.
LATER, MAN!!
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man.
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
Why?  Then they'll notice when I'm gone.  Well.  I'm making a public appearance aren't I?
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
I'm sure, I don't know.
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
If I may be so bold...
For the gods, spit it out!
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
You're coming back?
I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
What is that... wailing?
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
What are you talking about?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
Yes?  Go on!
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
I want that bastard dead!
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
I am their hero!
Not yet, dear brother...
Send them out!
Do you want posters, too?
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
What have I got now?  It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds.  He is their champion.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.
That's difficult to say, general.
Gladly Caesar.
Or perhaps into a new one.  But here's to your God and the courage of our legions...
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
You flatter me, Caesar.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar?
That this illness has clouded his mind.
We have to stop the Germans now!
They won't break this one.
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate.  I could have executed you.
And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube.
On what charge?
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
At least stay for the running of the animals.  You are paying for it you know...
Until your confirmation date.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
So am I.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Give away food?
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Take grain away from the army?
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I'm certain father will be in better humors by then.  Now, honor us with your presence at dinner.  I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician.
He left us at dawn.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Jerses -- tomorrow...
Yes, Caesar.
We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics.  For the poor.  Citizens only, though...
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
I don't know...
I'll nose around...
You know there were riots last night.  Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division.  You understand what you are doing...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
The exact month when the Emperor must be confirmed!
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?
Yes, because I know they'll read it.
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
I've read of it.
But have never been?
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
I hope you live to see what I believe...
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
You don't know how wrong you are.
Why you?
My loyalties... were in doubt.
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
That's what worries me...
Only from a distance.
Sneaking around with your brother?
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Why do you play at being drunk?
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
Yours will do!
But you do exist.  Narcissus:  hero of the battle of the Danube.
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
"But what if I wish to be purple?"
Would that Marcus had lived.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
He killed his father and then my family...
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
Servis made it through again?
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
So I understand.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
The Senators admire you.
They fear me.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
Tomorrow?
As soon as I can.
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
On my honor as your daddy...
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Well, we can try...
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
Rome is going to pay an allotment to the German tribes on an annual basis.
My troops don't make policy.
Well, they die for it!
I can't let you do that.
I was summoned.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Greeks?
Athenians...
They're studying with Cynics.
Of course...
I can see that...
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
Let him trust Quintus.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
No!
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
I don't want you to die!
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
You teach them!
That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Death is a very light thing for you.
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
Chain him.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
-- to fight?  We'll see...
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
That's one way to look at it.
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Think about it!  Just think about it!
Alive... I'm alive...
Don't be ridiculous.
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
You get to come alive again in the country!
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
It's absolutely not like that!  This is for your own good!  Come on get the rest of your armor on!
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Oh, shit.  Take your time!  Don't get suckered!  This man is a murderer!  In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators.  Please, just take the fall!
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Then get a large cash advance.
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Before they leave, get gold.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
Was I?
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
Hello.
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.
Are you going to graduate school?
No.
Yes.
I'd love some.
No.
Why not?
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
No -- why should I?
I don't know.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
I think I'd better go home now please.
But, Elaine --
Where is the car?
I just want to tell you something.
What?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
No, I couldn't.
But could you try?
No.
Yes, I do.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
All right.
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Of course not.
Yes.
You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Yes.
With a family?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Did they ever find out?
No.
And it's all over now.
Yes.
I'm glad.
Okay.
You sure you really want to?
Yes.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
I do.
You do?
Benjamin -- I really do.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
That woman --
That woman. The older woman.
You mean the one who --
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Oh my God --
GET OUT!
Don't cry.
Get out of here.
Ah. Where?
At the Zoo.
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
I've never been to it.
No.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Oh.
Here? In Berkeley?
Yes.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
But you're not enrolled.
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
-- really incredible --
Here he comes.
What?
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Come in.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Because -- I am.
Is it because I'm here?
What do you think?
I think it is.
All right then! Yes!
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
What?
I don't understand --
Did you say rape her?
What did she say?
Let me go.
Because it isn't true.
I don't feel well.
Then what?
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
If you want.
My belt.
Don't you have it on?
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
The marble?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
Oh.
I don't know.
No.
I don't understand.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
But Elaine --
What?
Will you kiss me!
I don't know.
But you might.
I might.
Is that so? You might marry me?
Yes.
When?
I don't know.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
You mean you're confused?
I don't see how we can.
We just can.
I'll think about it.
You really will?
Yes.
Tomorrow?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
Why wouldn't it?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Carl who?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Yes.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
No, Benjamin.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Oh no. He said that.
Shhhh.
Where did he do it?
No.
The day after tomorrow?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
What?
Hello -- who is this?
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Is the doctor anywhere?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Thank you.
I certainly hope you --
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Ben.
Yes, sir.
Are you listening?
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
Yes, I will.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Not exactly.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
What are you then?
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
Ahhh.
What?
One of those outside agitators.
Oh -- no sir.
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
Who screamed?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
Because I don't like you.
I want you out of here.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I am going to call the police now.
Could I make one phone call first?
Get out!
Yes.
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
I'm in the bathroom.
Well here's the purse.
Could you bring it up?
Well I'll hand it to you.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Right.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Benjamin?
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Where are you?
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Where are you?
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
Did you get a room?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Give me an hour.
What?
I'll be there in an hour.
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
The Singleman party, sir?
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.
Ahh -- thank you.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Will you sign the register, please?
What? No. Nothing.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Oh no.
Sir?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Of course.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Whatever you say, sir.
It's down the hall.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
No.
Is what a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
In general.
That's right.
What?
Will you take me home?
What?
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
No.
Right.
What?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
What for?
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
But it's light in there now.
Please.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you drink?
Why not?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?
I don't know.
No.
Yes.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
I'm very neurotic.
What do you mean?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
What?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Sit down, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
No.
What?
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What's wrong?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
What?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Like what?
What do you think?
Well I don't know.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
So?
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's all right.
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Sit down.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Her portrait?
Yes.
No.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Very much.
Benjamin?
Yes?
Will you unzip my dress?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I know that. But I'm --
Come on.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Then why do you keep running away?
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
Yes, I have --
What if he did?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Why is it?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
Would you like me to seduce you?
What?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Where is it?
On that chair in the hall.
Get away from that door.
I want to say something first.
Jesus Christ!
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Oh my God.
Let me out!
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
I've got to go.
Yes.
Thank you for taking me home.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Of course.
Very well. Thank you.
A drink? Of course.
Waiter!
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
What?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I haven't. No.
Do you want to?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Do you want to get it now?
Now?
Yes.
Well -- I don't know.
Why don't you get it.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
That's fine.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Well -- goodbye then --
Benjamin.
Yes?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
To tell you?
Yes.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
The number.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Thank you.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
What?
A hanger.
What?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Either one will be fine.
Okay.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Are you afraid of me?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Is this -- what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
On your first time --
Who said it was my first time?
That you're afraid --
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
INADEQUATE!
If you want.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Are you tired of it?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Anything. Anything at all.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Well?
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
How about art.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Oh.
Don't you?
Go ahead then.
Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
Neither.
You're not interested in art?
No.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
I don't.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Do you really want me to?
Yes I do.
I got up.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What one.
What?
What novel did you read.
I don't remember.
There!
What?
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Him?
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
There isn't any.
There's no risk?
I walk out.
You walk right out the door.
He's asleep.
Always?
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We're talking.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Now let's keep going here.
Right.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
We don't.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
No we don't.
Well how long has this been going on.
About five years.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
No.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
Not exactly.
But you don't hate him.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
I don't.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Is it?
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
No.
What?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
See if you can guess.
Well I can't.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Don't tell Elaine.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Are you shocked?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
What?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Was he a law student at the time?
At college.
Yes.
What was your major?
Why are you asking me all this?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
Art.
Art?
Well how did it happen?
How do you think.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
We'd go to his car.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
I don't think we were the first.
What?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
That's enough.
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
Don't talk about Elaine?
No.
Why not?
Because I don't want you to.
There's nothing to tell.
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Good.
I was just kidding around.
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.
No.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Let's drop it.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
Benjamin?
Yes.
I wouldn't know.
Well, I'm not.
You're not.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
I see.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Are you?
Don't start acting hurt.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Did I say that?
Of course you did.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
You wouldn't.
Of course I wouldn't.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
If that's how you feel --
But it's not.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
But if it's sickening for you --
You don't have to say that.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
May I stay then?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Thank you.
Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Do exactly what I say.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
How?
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
I don't believe you.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Go home now.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Where is Elaine?
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
What the hell have you done?
I don't think so.
Sir?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Very good, sir.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Hey -- I don't get it.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Sure.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
What?
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
When I go off?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
What else?
Nothing else.
Oh, no.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Meet someone?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
No wait. Wait.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Not if you don't want to.
I do.
But I don't want you to make up something.
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
Goodnight, Benjamin.
You believe me, don't you?
No.
You don't?
Goodnight.
I do.
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No -- they don't.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
We haven't.
-- worried?
Well --
About what?
I guess -- about my future.
What about it?
I don't know. I want it to be --
To be what?
Different.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Have you thought about graduate school?
No.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
That has nothing to do with it --
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
Swell. I appreciate it.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Yes, sir.
Oh no.
I've got to go.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Thank you.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
Sir?
You'll never be young again.
I know.
Ben, can I say something to you?
What?
How long have we known each other now?
Quite a while.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
Thank you.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
I'd like to hear it.
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
Oh no.
What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
Oh yes.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
I will.
Great.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
I will.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Yes.
Mr. Robinson?
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
No, it's not --
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
I am not threatening you.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
No, I don't.
But why?
Why?
That's quite a statement.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
You miss the point.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
HUH?
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you look through the glass.
Yes, I can.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
I'd like to discuss this.
Dad -- can you listen --
I'll give you ten seconds.  He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
They are?  Come on.
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I don't believe it.
That what he says. Right?
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
Splendid!
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the --
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Time's getting short.
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
Not now.
Yes, sir.
Well?
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
And what are you going to do?
The pearls are in her room.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
Need any help?
No.
Have you got that skeleton key?
Why?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
I could take care of her.
How?
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
No -- no -- no -- no...
Why?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
No --
With the pearls?
You can't.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
What about the money?
How?
I have an idea working in my head...
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
Not with strangers.
You're a fool!
Yes, I am rather.
Who?
Have you seen it?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
That.
You?
Oh -- work!!
Oh!
Dictation.  You know...
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Reducing?
No -- why? -- should I?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Very little.
Too bad.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
Aren't you?
What?
Free --
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Where downstairs?
Yellow Room where they dance --
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Of course.
Really?
All right. We'll dance.
Sorry.
Chasing what?
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Will you do me a big favor?
I'll do anything for you.
Yes -- I'd love to.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Why?
I feel sorry for him.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Anything for you.
Yes --
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
You live here?
For tonight.
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
What do you want here?
Nothing -- only to be here.
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Because you love me -- you love me?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
Certainly.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
And -- and --
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired...
So alone.
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Am I quite strange to you?
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
And...?
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
Go away. Who are you --?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
Yes -- I do understand.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
I want to be alone.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
I want to be alone --
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Just for a minute then.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
I should like to smoke.
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --
What can you see?
You are beautiful!
No.
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
What?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
I want to be alone.
That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
Really?
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
And?
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
And what do you do -- now?
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
That's a silly joke.
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
What is the matter?
Oh --
I don't want them now.
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
So --
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
And now?
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Yes.
You do believe that I really love you?
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
I'll go -- good-bye.
Shall I see you again?
I --
When are you leaving Berlin?
Very early in the morning.
For Vienna?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Why later?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
I can't.
No?
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Why do you think --
Why?
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
On the train?
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Till then.
Bless you --
Not at all, sir.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Oh, a Baron!
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Then you know him?
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Yes, quite.
We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
If we could scare up some men to play.
We could come to my room.
Good!
Ready, Baron.
No -- not at all.
All right then.
All right then.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Goodnight, Kringelein.
No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Well -- last night was not so good.
I thought she was splendid!
Yes -- but the audience.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Yes, I was in the war.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
I did not ask your advice.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
As you will.
I must have made a mistake.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Be quiet.
I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat!
Don't do that.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
And the child isn't coming?
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Good heavens. What for?
I don't know.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Most imposters are --
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
Anyone asked for me?
Nobody, Doctor.
No, doctor.
This gentleman can have my room.
Oh!
Send his bags up to my room.
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
You are ill.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
The Grand Hotel.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night.
But Doctor --
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
What, Doctor?
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Everything?
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
Stay where you are.
No -- I must find it --  Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
No.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.
Oh, don't go.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
No - absinthe.
Yes -- that --
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
A man might what?
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
Oh -- you would!
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Yes.
You dance splendidly.
Really?
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Oh -- what -- what --
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Preysing?
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Yes --
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Money!
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
What?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Do you like me better?
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
Then you will please wait outside.
Moreover --
Moreover...
No -- only occasional jobs.
Tired?
You pay me.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover...
Movies?
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
I got ten marks for that.
Me.
Moreover...
What?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
What brown hands you have.
That's from skiing.
Skiing?
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Perhaps.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
With the same friend?
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Not too quickly.
What?
You're a little too fast.
Can't you understand me?
I understand you perfectly.
Have you got it now?
Cotton Company --
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
...weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Definitely off.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
Hello!
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
It's urgent.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Tomorrow morning.
No -- now.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Nothing.
Well -- you want me?
Yes.
Well?
I must go to England -- at once.
Well?
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
I understand perfectly.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
A thousand marks --
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
Oh, yes.
Insolent young cub!
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Baron!
Well, he's a gentleman!
I had to arrange about the trip.
You're sweet.
Here, hold up!
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Oh, no.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
Exactly.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
Shhh -- here he is now.
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
I mean with the Manchester people?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
All right.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Mop rags --!
No water -- What a place!
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
We did not approach you.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Of course you took the initiative.
And I said we didn't.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
What?
You've decided against the merger?
Yes --
Then, it's all over?
Yes --
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester.
What?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen.
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Preysing, you're joking with us.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Next week.
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
We did not approach you.
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
Goodnight, Suzette.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
Oh!
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Oh -- but it can't be.
Why not?
Take them back, Suzette.
You haven't time.
Such nonsense.
I wish to be alone.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
The performance -- the performance -- the performance.
What -- what is it? Last night...
Last night?... There was no applause.
There was -- there was.
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
But when did he go? How do you know?
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Certainly, sir.
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
Please.
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
I could not think of not accepting.
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
What is this insolence?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Go away -- go away.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
You're discharged.
Me?
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
-- We must do something...
Yes, the police must be called.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Yes, I know them --
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
We must call the police, your excellency.
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Madam Grusinskaya's car.
Have I kept you waiting?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
No news yet?
No. No word.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I know -- I know.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Good night.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Well -- gentlemen.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
That.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on...
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
What you need is some relaxation.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
What do you want with her?
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Pretty as a picture.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
I want to keep my teeth.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Bobo, no, I --
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son --
Your what?
My son was in the hospital --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You expect me to buy this?
It'll never happen again. I swear.
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
No.
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
And if you do it wrong?
What's that, Lilly?
You'll never shit right again.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
You want a drink?
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
You're a thousand percent right!
You know it, Lilly.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Roy? He's always crying.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
I like you, too.
Oh, everything's the same size, same price.
Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Right in front of the room.
Fine.
No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
Goody!
Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
So here we are!
Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
We're not really interested, Henry.
Henry, no!
Can't move.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
I certainly hope not.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
Not much time.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
You brought a case? Good.
What? He's going to be all right!
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Well, make it stop!
You know who I work for.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
Why? What's wrong?
You are a valued customer, as you know.
But what's wrong?
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
But they must be! They cut glass!
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
I'll get you a check.
It's not your fault.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Hello.
Roy Dillon.
I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
Lead on.
So I heard.
Just myself.
That's right, you've had to supervise yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who's proved he's a salesman and can handle other salesmen. He'd have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?
I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Well, uh... No.
No?
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Well...
Oh, sure. Fine.
Perk.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Perk, remember?
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Fair enough.
They twisted my arm.
Only one arm?
Only one tooth?
Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
Don't mention it.
I guess I owe you my life.
You always did.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
How come?
No. And you have to be.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Sure.
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
Bluebell came in?
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
Get off the grift, Roy.
Why?
You don't have the stomach for it.
That's right.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
I pay my debts.
You do?
No. That was the point.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
You, too, Roy.
Well, that's good news.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I've really got to --
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
As though you do what I say.
This way's perfect.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
You must have some money.
Just a few bucks.
And Myra's stuff?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
At what?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
What?
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I know you do, so that's why --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
No.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I'll get it.
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
Not very good!
Uh-huh.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
Never.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
For God's sake, Lilly!
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
No.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
I don't?
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
I don't see why not.
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
A future. The only future I've got.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
Just trying to help, Lilly.
What?
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
NO!
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
Joe, you know you'll --
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
This time...
We'll work something out, Joe.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
Scram. Go home.
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
I am in school.
In your other hand.
Always, for you, baby.
Taking you for granite?
Are you sure?
Mm?
Look at me.
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
Roy? It this all we have?
All? It ain't bad.
No more than this?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
No, baby. Come to Mama.
You called the doctor, huh?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
I want to know everything about you.
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
Mama!
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
That's just Lilly's way.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Oh, don't be stupid.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
Every day in every way.
I'll see you when you get home.
Because it's comfortable.
We'll rent a car.
You ain't seen nothin.
I'll sign that affidavit.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
You already went back to work.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
Working the what?
Oh, come on, Roy.
I'm a salesman.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.
The long end. Big con.
Nobody does that single-o.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
I've heard the name.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Is that right?
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
And when he got serious?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
I thought these people were broke.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Yeah? How?
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
Where?
Upstate.
Upstate where?
Atascadero.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just...
Take a hike, you mean?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
Sure.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
Open your door.
What?  What for?
Open it and find out.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I went out to Delmar.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I saw her.
She didn't see you, in other words.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
What?
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
I don't think I need it.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
Maybe I like it where I am.
No! Because I --
That's what I say.
What?
For Christ's sake, why not?
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
Bullshit!
I'm happy the way I am.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
) What?
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
Yes?
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
Thank you.
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
That's natural.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Gun?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
You up to it now?
Sure. Let's get it over.
Yes, I know, I know.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
What?
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Ate the gun. Oh.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
Not many.
No question, huh?
No, its -- Why did she--?
Oh, yeah. That's that.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
Happy to see you looking so good.
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Well, when you put it that way.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
I like a woman who takes control.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
No blood on the knife.
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Where?
The cemetery...
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
I can be real stiff.
Charming.
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Yes.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
Do I know you?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Detective...
Carter.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown.  We got a dead body in there.
It's Amy Kramer.
My god...
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Doesn't look good.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Oh.  Sorry.  I'm on my way to the ring and --
I think someone broke into my house.
No shit.
Checking out your place.
No.  Wait for the police.
And miss the big game?  No way.
You sure?
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Nothing's missing?
My office?
Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
You're so predictable.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
No.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Forget it.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
My point exactly.  See, we both agree.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
My life is a living hell.
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
I thought you'd never ask.
I know.
Nothing.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
It's an option.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
Just forget it...
Will, sit down...
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
Yes.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
I was trying to protect you from this...
Get on the bus.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
I'm not leaving without her.
John, you can't help her now.
What?  Where is she?
John...
Please, get on the bus...
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
That would work.
Where'd you get it?
You stole it?
I borrowed it.
Why not?
I can't afford to get caught.
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
I came to see you.
I can see that.  Why?
Can I come in?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
Then you come out here.
Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
I'm okay.
Here, take my jacket.
Yeah.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Okay... thank you.
Who?!
Looks great.  It does.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
It's always John.
Still wants to move out?
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
This kid just wants his freedom.
It's not going to happen.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Bye Will.
What?
What are you looking at?
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
What?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
You're right.  It does sound strange.
Michael Meyers.
The serial killer?
He's my brother.
I can't believe this is happening.
Shit happens.
Are you going to leave, too?
Yeah.
Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
Oh, right.  Sorry.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
We've got to get these kids out of here...
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
What is it?
I have to pee.
Can't you hold it?
Can't you?
I did alright.
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
You're unbelievable.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
Shit, Linda!
You're so easy...
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
Thanks!
Where's Shane?
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Very insightful.
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Oh, don't be such a victim.
Pig.  What the hell happened this time?
Why?  You interested?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Is Tim there?
He's in the bathroom.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
We can light our own tree at home.
Guess so ...
Then they can watch.
Answer what?
What if it's Kara?
The voice man!  He's here!
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
But I've seen him!
He says things.  Bad things.
Like what?
Okay ... But just for tonight.
You can't expect us to stay here --
Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Promise?
I promise.
Danny!!!
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.
Who are you?
What makes you think he'll come here again?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
God ... this can't be true.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
You stay away from him!
Him.
Here.  Let me try.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.
It's a rune ... Thorn.
Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'
Halloween.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
He's gone.
Kara, no!
Wait a minute ...
It's not working!
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
But surely Rogers isn't --
Retiring.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
Or what's left of him.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
An old friend.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
I'll meet you over there.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
This is madness, Wynn.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Why did you take Jamie?
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Jamie's baby ...
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Samhain.
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Stay away, Sam.
Leave the boy.  Take me.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
No one.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
No!!!
I dunno, boy.
Hm?
It's a bitch.
A bitch.
Didn't recognize you.
We've never met.
I wonder who'll recognize us first? They'll wet their pants.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
We'll see.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Home is important to a man.
No.
How all the magazines show tits today.
Um.
I suppose.
Must have changed that law.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
At least!
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Tell them yourself!
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
I didn't tell you everything.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
This room is full of ghosts.
Go home!
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
The hell with the diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Can I have the Cadillac?
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
What'll you do for transportation?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
Go home!
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
Go home.
I'm liable to find anything!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
So long, Colonel.
You know what gets me?
How short the skirts are.
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Something very important about sex must have happened while we were gone.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Months?
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
I'm lonesome already.
Go home!
You ever own a motorcycle?
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
Haven't got one.
Let's talk about something else.
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
First Nagasaki--now this.
How about breakfast, wife?
The educational process.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
You know me, boy.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
Huh.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
How do you know that?
You told me.
When?
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Really?
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Sorry.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I didn't know we had any women left.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
I dunno.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
What's this?
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
You did?
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Maybe it's time you got out.
Me?
You.
You're an imbecile.
I know you think that.
Everybody thinks that.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
I don't think so.  It could have been.
If what?
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
How are you, honeybunch?
Is Penelope in?
The posies are for her?
I wanted to apologize.
You've come to the right man.
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
I forget mine for years on end.
Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
Our pleasure.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
Blue soup.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Pass the fucking catsup.
You actually sold insurance!
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
I've considered that.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
You're making a joke.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
What?
We got to get another pilot.
For what?
For Africa.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
You invited me.
What went wrong?
We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
Gee whiz--
I wouldn't drop my gun.
You're hollow, like a woman.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
You're my buddy.
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Out!
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Thank God!
As a matter of fact--
Sir?
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Hello.
Hello.
Are you--
Are you--do you--
Ask it!
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Life has denied me that thrill.
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
Dr. Woodly.
Is anybody besides you here now?
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
You don't know where your mother is? Does she put on a short skirt and go drinking all night?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
Man and boy.
Everybody says he was so brave.
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
He worships Father.
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
College!
They were in the same creative writing class.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
He insults him all the time.
Excellent!
What's good about that?
It makes life spicy.
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
England?
Oh hell.
Dad was never in England?
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
"The sting."
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
"The sting."
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Tell me that.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
Wow.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Mhravitch.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Uck.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
I don't know.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Go on.
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, "Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia."
Mhravitch.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Sir?
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're supposed to get hurt!
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
They're not engaged.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Go ahead.  No, no, no, no.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Can't it keep till morning?
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Penelope!
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Will you go to bed?
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Scat!
Damn.
Mom?
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
The smallest thing I've got.
Can I get dressed first?
Make it fast.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Leave a tip.
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
Who was it?
It's Mom.
What's this?
Nothing.
That's a rifle you have?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
No.
Open the bolt!
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
Dad--
Too late!  It's man to man now. Protecting your mother from me, are you?  Protect her!`
I don't want to fight you.
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
It's your house, Dad.
I'm talking to you gently now.
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
Heaven.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Eighteen--  and a half.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Sir?
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
What time do you get off work, my child?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
I'm engaged.
Daughter--I love you very much.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
This is crazy.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
What do you do for a living?
Some kind of animal?
The pelt is black.  It's a kind of man.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
Not at all.
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
Give us time.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Disease?
Situation.
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Your old beau?
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
We all are.
Shouldn't you lie down?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
Nothing would please me more.
Have some.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
Please--
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Say hello to your mother.
Do say hello to your mother.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
I did?
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
A trip, you mean?
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
It's so--so stark.
You used to like it stark!
I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
Turn around?
I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
I have a brain.
We all do.  But now it's body time. Relax.  Ideally, the body of a woman should feel like a hot water bottle filled with Devonshire cream. You feel like a paper bag crammed with curtain rods.  Think of your muscles one by one.  Let them go slack.  Relax.  Let the brain go blank.  Relax.  That's the idea-- that's my girl.  Now the small of the back.  Let those knots over those kidneys unsnarl.
Ram it up your ass!
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Which one?
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
What a honeymoon.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
You're wrong.
Then let me see him go out and get some exercise.  Right now!
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
You're a woman, aren't you?
People don't use that word any more.
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
No.
What then?
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
That's what you're supposed to say.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
It couldn't!
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Fish can't feel.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Such as?...
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Tell me about its sexual roots.
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted.  It's just the truth.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
Go on.
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
You learned this in some college course?
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
The doctor.
Yes.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
And no one's there now?
I don't think so.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
No you're not!
Why not?
Sneaking in the back door.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
I came for Paul as well.
If he wants to go.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
A dozen?
It's a big and busy funeral home.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
Unless she has nerve.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
He knows you shattered his violin.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
He cried.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
Two hundred years old.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Hope.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Almost a Christmas scene.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Just one favor.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
I see.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Rifle?
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Blue soup?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
Like what?
Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
I plan to live one hundred years!
No you don't.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
Honor, I suppose.
What a handsome word.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
No.
No.
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
You hope this, too?
Don't!
Stop!
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Ah!  The lady is armed.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
I mean it!
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Where's the bullet?
There it is.  Give it to me.
Load it for her.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
Out!
You've killed women?
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Ooops.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
It's always locked.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
He's dead, you know.
Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
Hello, Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Oh dear.
Call her back--tell her to head for the hospital.  Tell the hospital to expect her.  I'll leave right now.
We'll miss you so.
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.
Ahh--then she's still alive.
She's fine.  Please--
Will you please go?  An emergency!
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
Yes!  Please!  You've got to get out right now!
And her fianc�!
And her fianc�!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
I've got to run!
I've literally got to run!
I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
I came back.
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
She's crying because she's so happy.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc� is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Good night.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
You've been bitten by bats?
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
You have chills?
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
I was going to ask.
Pacqualinincheewa root.
Would you say that again?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
I've never heard of it.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Are you've seen it work cures?
Hundreds.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
We have, have we?
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
Everything about you is the editorial we.  Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
You were wrong, you quack!
What for?
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's a certain amount of information there.
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
What brought you back?
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
He's a champion after all. WOODLY Of the corpses and cripples you create for our instruction--when all we can learn from them is this: how cruel you are.
Yes.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
Correct.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You haven't heard me yet.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
We'll find out now, won't we?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
You're old--so old.
Now who's being cruel?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
Comical?
And terror, if you don't mind.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
I'm an honorable clown?
King Arthur.
You hope.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
Cut me open.  Find out.
I've struck my blow.
With spittle?
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
Poison.
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
I see.
You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
My violin is avenged!
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
The new hero is you.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
You're too modest.
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
Was I ever of use?
I'm utterly satisfied.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
More clowning!  Don't you see?
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
I'm going to shoot you now.
No!
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
If you want to be found that way.
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
Don't shoot.
I've enjoyed being man.
Get up.
Have it your way.  We'd both be better off dead now.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
It's trash now, like mine.
New lives begin!
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
What are you going to do?
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
You don't know?
It was a bitch.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
She did?
You didn't even find that out?
There was so much going on.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
Jesus.
Alice is dead?
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
For what?
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Who's dead?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
What happened?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
How horrible.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
I dunno.
What will you do, Colonel?
I'm only ten years old.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
I heard you were looking for me.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
That is sad.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Ja?
Never mind.  It's a dumb theory.  I was going to say it was all sexual..but everything is sexual...but alcohol.  Peace.
Something's made you sore.
Don't worry about it.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Kid--kid--
And I wish you'd quit touching me all the time.  It drives me nuts!
What's this?
Don't!
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
I don't want to live any more.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
I'll kill myself.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
No.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
I know.
Stay home tonight!
Oh, Paul--
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
He's a ghost!
He's alive!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
Thank you, kind sir.
A what kind of doctor?
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Not true.
Still lives with his mother.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I was afraid to ask.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
I didn't know that.
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I don't really know.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
It's beautiful.
Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Who have you been talking to?
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Then who flushed the toilet?
Father's friend.
What's his name?
Don't know.
For Heaven's sakes!
That man is your father.
What?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
I don't get it.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
What does he say to do?
He can hardly talk.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Yeah.
Then get him.
Okay.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
You're going out?
Oh?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
My father!
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
Don't worry about it.
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
It's fine!
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
Keeps fairies away!
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
He is my father.
No!
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
Doing what?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
He'd assume we had.
That's something I suppose.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I'm glad.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I know.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
You don't wrestle if you don't have supreme confidence, and I wrestled. But when I get with you, and I say to myself, "My God--here I am with the wife of Harold Ryan, one of the great heroes of all time--"
Something happens to my confidence.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
I'm touched.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
I see.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Good night.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one.  Shall we go?
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
Yeah.
Is he all right?
Far as I know.
Is he coming home?
The park!
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
You figure!
Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
A what?
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
How nice.
They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
What was it?
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
How long has this been going on?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
I'm sorry.
Marry me instead.
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You're saying no.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Take plenty of cigars.
I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
She quit this afternoon.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
What?
Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
Tonight's the night.
It is?
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
The what?
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
What kind of a life is that?
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
I wish Paul luck.
It's suicide!
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
Meaning?
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
Why would you do that?
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
I'm amazed.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
They didn't murder me.
Paul's only twelve years old.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
We've got to rescue him.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
It's a jungle out there.
He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
We met here earlier this evening.
How neat.  How keen.
I believe in miracles now.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
It's really that bad?
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Goodbye.
I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
Is that a fact?
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Not true.
Or get eaten alive.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Phooey.
Penelope!  We're late!
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
He died of a massive rupture.
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
It's good.  Let him go.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
Don't!  Let him have all the privacy he wants.  Let him grieve, let him rage.  There has never been a funeral for his father.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Yes, we do.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
No.
What we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. It's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. Anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tips are allowed. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
You mean I'm black?
No, just not the type.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
But is she, has...
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
What are you doing?
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
Yeah.
Do you want to take a session?
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
You'll be fine.
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No, I don't.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Pull out your cock.
What?
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Are you going to stiff me?
What do you mean?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
You want a tip?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
What do you mean?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
That's cool.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
I'm getting angry. I want some answers.  Where's the guy who runs this place?
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
How many weeks?
Just one.
Okay.
'Film Producer seeks young men, 18 to 25, for hardcore film. Prior film experience a must. Call Jake at Players Motel. 777 Vine. 463-5671.
Yeah.
We offer...
Yeah, yeah...
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I don't know no Tod.
What girls you got here?
That's all you got, three girls?
Man, how many girls do you need?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
That's Charity. She's out back. She'll be free in half hour.
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
No, no. I wouldn't hire a display designer if I didn't trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade. Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
What's that shade of blue called?
Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
Sam?
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Overpowering?
Yeah.
Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock that Pavonine blue a bit.
Are you sure it's all right?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
If you say so.
Yeah. How did you know?
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
No.
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Yeah.
You making a feature?
Um-hm. Live sound.
Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this.
You know her?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Do you know where she lives?
Nah.
Do you know where she would be?
Tod might know.
Where's he?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Three hundred?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Up front?
Half now, half later.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
When do we start?
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
I am.
Huh?
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
Ulcers.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
Of Joanne's?
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Jesus.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
And your wife? Where's she?
She's dead.
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
At least I'm a growing person.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
What rate?
You know what I'm talking about.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
Say what?
'Sucking off.'
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
You don't understand shit.
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
Is that the way it was with you?
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
You used to work at Copper Penny?
No.
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
No.
Neither am I.
But it's all you do.
How important do you think sex is?
Not very.
We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
What do you care about?
I care about my daughter.
Tijuana.
They were here?
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
He deals in pain.
Is Kristen safe?
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
What the crap?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Shit.
Fuck.
I can stop if you want.
No, please go on.
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
He has to. That's Predestination. If God is omniscient, if He knows everything -- and He wouldn't be God if He didn't -- then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
More or less.
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
You really believe all that?
I thought I was fucked up.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
It's not quite the same thing.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Why can't I meet him now?
Where does he live.
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
They are the same.
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
On your own land?
But what?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
What makes you so sure?
You wife isn't dead is she?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
Granville?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
What happened?
Where is he?
I can't tell you that.
But then you'll forget about me.
Where is he, Niki?
Well, what do they know?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
So then, Mr. Mast...
Andy.
...What do you have to offer?
Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
You are.
That's right.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
And better?
Mr. Van Dorn?
Mast?
Yeah.
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
In G.R.? Why?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
I've got a meeting...
What are you paying me for?
What have you found out?
What do you mean?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
No.
That's like a stag film.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
No.
They're legal now.
They are?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Hmm.
There's a little stall theatre up here.  It's closed now, but I'm borrowing it for an hour. I think there's something you'd better see.
I don't know.
Where did you get that film?
Who made it?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
What's it called?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
The police? They know less than you do.
Do you think she's safe?
Yeah. Probably.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
Get out.
But this is my apartment.
Get out!
Do the police want to arrest me?
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Yeah, sure.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Who is Ratan?
I just heard. Who is he?
It's just a name.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Does she know anything about this?
Just leave me alone.
But I'm here to help you...
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you'll be all alone.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
Pretty good.
You should come around more often. You haven't been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
How did you find me?
I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here.  What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
What?
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
What is going on?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
What plan?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
That's not true, Mr...?
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at Les Girls. She would know. Honest.
Yeah.
No.
What you got in mind?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
You're talking about real excitement?
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
Who told you about this?
Rucker.
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Well...
Take it or leave it.
Okay.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
Good.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
Who?
Ratan!
Let's go.
What?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
They're all about the same. You want something?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
But I...
I don't know nothing, man.
No.
That's all right.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
What exactly do you have in mind?
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
Not exactly...
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
It's an investment.
I thought you were a businessman.
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
Jake.
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Sounds all right.
Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
What do you think of that? Or this?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
I don't know.
You ever play Chicken?
What's that?
You never heard of that?
Com'on, tell me.
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
Oh.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
I'll tell you, that was an interesting case. The Van Dorn girl. I've handled runaway cases like it before. Usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  I guess I gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Huh?
To his own daughter?
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Who's that?
The guy who bought you that ring.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
You're taking a big chance.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
At least I improved myself. What's up?
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
You working in San Diego now?
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Was he with a girl?
Thanks.
How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
Yes, I am.
And what are you studying?
Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Yes.
Oh, I don't have one.
Come again.
How long have you been driving?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Could I see your registration?
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Isn't this your vehicle?
No, no. I just took it.
Took it?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Lady, let me get this straight.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Hello.
None of that, lady.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Out!
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
We planted it.
Is this your shovel?
No.
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Officer, I can explain.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Check.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Where are the papers?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Wait here.
Because if you are...
What kind of a car is it?
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
How interesting.
Not very.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
I'm a file clerk.
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
A block of ice.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Eh, no.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
I don't know.
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Harold Chasen.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Nice to meet you.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
What?
Do you sing and dance?
Eh, no.
No.  I thought not.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
But this is my car.
Your hearse?
Yearse!
Oh.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
It's very interesting.
Oh, look! The birds.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
No.
Well then.
Sort of.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
All right.
My door is always open.
All right.
Promise?
Maude???!
Eh, fine.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
She seemed yare to me.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Me! No. Of course not.
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
No.
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
Yes. Very much.
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
It goes on and on.
That's really great.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
You don't look eighty.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
That's a nice teapot.
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
What do you mean?
I don't know. Just one of those.
Because they are all the same.
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Well...
Look.
What?
Over there by the courthouse.
What is it?
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
But what?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
But we can't just dig it up!
Why not?
But this is public property.
Exactly.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
Is he all right?
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
It is kind of rough.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Look, the ice is melting.
Yes.
Well, I really don't drink...
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Thank you.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
What were you fighting for?
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
No more revolts.
Well, I don't...
But I don't play anything.
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
Superb.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
I don't know.
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Yes. It's almost there.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Well, I really don't smoke.
It's all right.  It's organic.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Did Confucius say that?
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
You are the wisest person I know.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
What was that?
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
Of course.
Okay.
I like you, Maude.
I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
It's so blue.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Maude, do you pray?
With God?
With Life.
Well, why don't you?
No. I'd feel stupid.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Yodeling?
Where's that?
From the guys who got the matches, of course.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Oh.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
What is it, Harold?
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Well, don't go.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
She took my head.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Oh, you weren't scared.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Well, they're my species.
Do you think there is any life up there?
I don't know. Perhaps.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
You should have been a poet.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
Maude.
Yes.
Here.
I took them out.
Why?
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, Harold.
For you.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Farewell?
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
But why now?
I thought eighty was a good round number.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
It's true. I can't live without you.
"And this too shall pass away."
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Mother.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
I'm getting married.
To whom?
To a girl. Here.
What?
A sunflower?
At a funeral.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
I don't care what people say.
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
Harold!
Perhaps it is.
Can't complain.
No, thank you. They stain my fingers.
Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.
No. My uncle.
Oh, he's in the Army. I do so like the military, don't you? Those uniforms make men look so virile. I did "What Price Glory?" in summer stock. I played Charmaine - with a French accent.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Like a tea ceremony?
No. Like this.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
And why is that?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Just give me a rough estimate.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Fifteen.
A rough estimate.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
Does that worry you?
Yes. It does.
Why?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Ah, yes.
And a lot of time.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
What about the draft?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
I don't know.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
What else do you like?
I go to funerals.
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
No.
Well, maybe one.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
No.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
No.
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
Your classmates?
Yes.
Your studies?
Yes.
Then why did you leave?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Yes.
Very well.  Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
No.  I'd have liked to.
Why?
I'd have liked to talk to him.
What would you say?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Thank you, Uncle.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Yes, sir.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
War is not all black.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
Jeez! That's a great story,
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
You think so, sir?
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
To pit your own life against another.
That's right.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
Another man's life in your sights.
Yes.
ZAT!
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
How about hand-to-hand combat?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Eh?
How about to slit his throat?
Well, I don't...
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Harold!
What's the chance of getting one of these?
Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
She took my head.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Yes.
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Well, I didn't.
But wait...
Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
We've always been here.
We have no more surprises.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Time to play.
Julia.
Frank.
I knew you'd come.
You knew?
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Oh, I do. I do.
Shit. Bull. Shit.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
No. You look...
I know.
She certainly has.
It's coming.
It certainly is.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
You a doctor, too?
What's the matter with her?
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
God, that's terrible.
Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
What?
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
If anyone can help, HE can.
So you slept O.K.?
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
The boxes! I TOLD you.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
WHY?
Because I'm going to get my father!
What are you talking...
I've got to finish it.
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
It's been Hell.
Then why are you here?
I've come for my father!
And what about you?
No more deals, Kirsty. It's your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
Nonsense, I...
You were ALL human!
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Steve...
Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Oh, excuse me...
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
Yeah.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Who?
The Cenobites.
See what??
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Is he serious??
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Story of my life.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
You mean, outside... with her.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
We don't take hints.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
Red, I found something --
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
I'm lucky that way.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Oh, right --
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
See? I don't like that --
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
It doesn't say --
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
What is it?
In private, if you don't mind...
Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
Three days too late for that one, "professor."
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
Oh, I'll bet you have.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
From where??!!
No. It's not.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
That makes him more than a hundred --
No. It was red. Bright red.
I think that is its hand.
I thought you liked being on TV.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
He's just going through a phase --
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue, however, was hollow --
Reliquary --
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
I worry about you.
Me?? C'mon --
Well, I won't be around forever, you know?
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
Is it bad?
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Did he, now?
You're doing fine.
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Got tired of me?
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
We're on the move.
C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
Who?!
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
Noooo! Noooo!!!
Anung-un-Rama...
I can live with that.
I knew those men better than you did --
Ah, I see. That makes it all alright then.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
What are you trying to say?
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
I wish I could be more gracious but --
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Those things never work. Never.
Each of us gets a belt.
I won't take 'em. They never work.
Don't move. We --
-- should go back. Now!
No. Don't --
I'm in charge. We go back!
Yup.
You never, ever light a cigar that way.
My job.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Father's back?  Still angry?
Oh-n-no -- I --
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
My arm is fine. Where are you??
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
Myers?
Yes?
Goodbye.
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
No. I never was.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Hey. You: think twice --
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
Hostage negotiations.
Shh! Just a second.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Not hungry.
Not from you.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Alone?
How big can it be?
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Goodnight.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
Out? Out out?
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
You're going alone?
No. Myers is taking me.
Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Red, I --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
I like that...
Good.
Marco...
...Polo.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
Doesn't sounds like him.
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
He's just pushy.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Cocky.
Strong.
My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
What about you?
Coffee's warming me up.
What -- ?
That you feel that way about me.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
What?
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Yes, I --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Pardon?
Two steps back, please.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just take it slowly.
Oh, sod you.
What's the problem?
My fucking hand!
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Hi.
Want to buy a bed?
Not much.
We're leaving.
It'll go in.
Uh-huh.
Got her mother's looks.
Her mother's dead.
Julia's my second wife.
Lucky man.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
It's just a puzzle box.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Who are you?
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
No!
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
You did this before, right?
To a man called Frank Cotton?
HE did. I've seen him.
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
No. That wasn't the deal.
You can keep them.
I have to speak to my father.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
It's important.
You took quite a beating. You must lie down.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
I don't remember.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Oh Christ.
We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
Kirsty?
No.
You remember.
No.
Come to Daddy.
What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
This isn't happening.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
You want it?
This isn't happening.
Some things have to be endured...
Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
Poor baby.
Bastard.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Frank --
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
That's right. Who are you?
I'm brother Frank.
Oh.
I came for the wedding.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Well can I come in or not?
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
I don't want to see the dress.
But you said --
I don't want to see the dress.
Forget him.
I'm very happy.
Sure you are.
Oh my God.
Don't look at me.
Who are you?
I said: don't look.
Tell me who you are.
Frank.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What happened to you?
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Back from where?
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
Ssh!
The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back...
Hurting.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Good.
One more. Maybe two --
Who?
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
Keep your voice down.
You're hurting.
You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
Later.
What?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Not know.
You promised me an explanation.
A box?
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Let me see.
What kind of doors?
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Hell...
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Who did?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You're still afraid.
You would be. They tore me apart.
So you were cheated.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
I don't.
So where's the harm?
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Maybe.
There's very little I can do about it.
Maybe we should just leave --
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Well we can't just stay here --
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Hi. I got soaked.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Which is where?
Just to your left.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
Sure.
The keys are in the kitchen.
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
I have to see my father.
Of course. There's no need to shout.
I was here this afternoon.
This afternoon.
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
Oh my God.
We're going to freeze to death.
O.K. O.K.
Like who?
Just a thought --
Ah!
It's just been empty a while.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
You mean we're moving in?
No. I'm not.
You wanted to come back to London. We came back.
So what's the argument?
No argument.
Oh Christ. Julia...
I hear you.
In here.
He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit.
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
I cut myself.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
You're NOT going to faint.
Shit.
Let me see.
No, you're not.
So damn stupid.
You're done worse.
I'll be scarred for life.
No you won't.
Larry....
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
Are you O.K.?
I'm here.
Sweetheart... I've been calling you.
Just feeling a bit sick.
Can I get you anything?
Maybe a brandy.
Sure.
I'll be down in a minute
O.K.
O.K.
Kirsty.
I've seen worse.
Fine.
Only I'll turn it off --
No. I'll do it.
What's wrong with you?
Come with me then.
Please...
What's wrong with you?
Please. I can't bear it...
I don't know where to begin...
What are you talking about?
It's better you see for yourself --
What?
Drinking alone.
Not much.
I wonder, maybe...
Just soda.
Plain soda?
Please.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
That depends.
Oh?
There's a first time for everything.
I suppose that's right.
You want something to drink?
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
I... suppose so, yes.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
That's more like it.
Do you care ?
No, not much.
No personal details?
That's right.
No.
We don't need a bed, do we?
I prefer the floor.
That's right.
Yeah, why don't I?
Maybe I will.
Am I?
You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
What's wrong?
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
Wait a moment --
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
Try me.
Steve.
Daddy?
I got through.
Where are you?
I found a room.
What did you say?
No Dad.
You'd like the house.
YOU'D like my room.
Do you want me to come over?
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
You will keep in touch.
Of course. Every day.
O.K.
Call me tomorrow.
I will. See you.
You like?
Me like.
Is Julia here?
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Surprise.
Kirsty.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
Kitchen's through on your left.
Sure.
I've forgotten.
Steve?
Yeah.
I love you, honey.
I love you too.
I guess.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Really?
It's like she's waiting for something.
What?
I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
Sure.
Maybe all she needs is some company.
Of course.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Finished?
He's gone.
Gone?
I'm afraid it's true.
I want to see.
No you don't.
Yes!
Show her.
What's the problem?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
No. It's all over.
It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
I have to get out.
That's right. Cointreau.
So lie down.
Just upstairs.
I AM house-trained.
I thought we'd lost you.
I'm coming!  Sleep well.
It's late.
Not that late.
All right.  No. That's nice.
If there's a train.
What do we do if there isn't?
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
I see.
She's so damn... English.
We're not all frigid.
Oh no.
It's not what I heard.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
Are you alright ?
I've been better.
Your father told me you were working here.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
No, it's good to see you.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Can I lend you a hand?
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
It's a fetish of mine.
What things?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
I won't let anybody take you.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
What did I say?
Will you GO, damn you?
'Bye.
I don't know.
Really.
Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
You gotta be kidding me.
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
I beg your pardon?
Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
What's next?
Play it.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
We'll do it next Monday.
Well what's the point in that?
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Not the point.
Oh, so what's the point then?
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
What did he ever do to you?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
But now I kind of like it.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
We can take your car.
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
What do you mean, "what?"
What are you snickering about?
Ehh.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think?
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Ha.
How do you know about that?
Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Suck my ass.
Terrific.
What the fuck is that?
My band.
What band?
The band that found me and asked me to join.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
None.  Christ!
You're not even coming?
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
Laura.  Her dad died.
Ooh.  Drag.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Fuck off, Barry.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Haven't seen it.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
Not really.
No way.
Yes way.  It's really...
What?
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
So?  You even said they're good.
HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
We're getting that anyway.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
No.  We need the gig.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Sonic Death Monkey.
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not.  Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
I have all of the others.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
I have a television.
NO--!
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Oh well.  Nevermind.
Nothing.
Bullshit.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
That's what I said.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
You can be and are wrong.
On Clark Street!
A couple blocks!  About six!
We work there!
You'd love it!
Why?
Nobody.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Oh, hi.
Where's Rob?
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
What are you talking about?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Uh.  That's me.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Right.  Why?
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Oh.  Okay.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Huh.  You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in.  You must have only been about sixteen.
Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Pardon me?
Your desert island top-five.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
What do you mean, four more?
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Fine.  That's great.
Is that it?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Yeah.
What's his name?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin City."
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Hey Rob.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Good weekend?
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Great.
I'll tape it for you.
No, that's okay.  Really.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Okay.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Can I help you?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
Fine.
I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
I understand, Dick.
Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
Yeah.
I want a tape.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Marie LaSalle is in the store!  Here, she's here, and now!
-- FUCK OFF!
Do it.  Do it.
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
It's Vince and Justin.
Who's that?
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
You look upset.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
I dunno.
Think about it, Rob.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
Think about it, Rob.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
Well stay for tonight, then.
I should be so lucky.
Hi.
Hi.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Are you coming home?
My house?
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
-- Alright, alright but --
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
But don't you remember?
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
You really believe that?
And do you like it that way?
Not really.
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
I think you know that.
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
What were the others?
Just the obvious stuff.
What's the obvious stuff?
No.
What, what?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
I don't know.
I suppose so.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Yeah.  Great.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Fine.  One.
It sounds stupid.
Nevermind.
You won't like it.
Just ask it!
Is it better?
Is what better?  Better than what?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
Of course it is.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
Never?
I haven't felt like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
We'll talk some other time.
Great... That's great.
Have you slept with him yet?
I told you I slept with him.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I guess.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
Nothing.
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
Will you call me?
I don't have your number.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
You do, huh.
It's me.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
I'm not -- hold on...
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Think about what I said.  I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
You don't ever think about other people?
No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
Is that the last of it?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
It was kind of funny.
You still together?  Going all right?
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
That bad, eh?
You know what I mean.
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
Ray.  I hate Ian.
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
You know I'm a good person.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
Those aren't mine.
Sure they are.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
Well, think about it.
Hey, how ya doin'?
I can't talk right now.
Pigsty.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Pig died.
Who the fuck's Pig?
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
No, no.  When are you going home?
In a minute.  When I get it together.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Do you want me to be there?
Yes, of course.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
Uh... No.
You're also an idiot.
What do you mean?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
I don't want to go back.
What do you want to do?
C'mon.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
What?
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Hi.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
What about Ian?
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Mission accomplished.
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Okay.
What it was like.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
What's the difference?
You know the difference.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
To make you feel better.
Oh, great...
Okay.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
How?  How were we the same people?
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
No, but...
But what?
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
You're tougher.
More confident, maybe.
Harder.
I'm alright.
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
You're being stupid.
How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
No use.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Nothing.
Wanna go to dinner?
Where?
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
Ha.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
WHAT?
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Barry said its done.
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
We took care of that.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
I know.  I don't get it.
Not really.
I'm going to talk to you.
Right.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I mean it.
I know.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Not in love, exactly, but...
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
Would you marry me if I was?
No.  Probably not.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
I don't know.
Very persuasive.
Are you persuadable?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Fair enough.
So?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
About what?
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
Well, you've asked.
Hey.  It's Liz.
What's happenin'.
You called this morning?
How're you holding up?
It's true!
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
Well she --
It's a crematorium.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
What difference does it make?
Is Ray going?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Enough of what?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Good.
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Everything go alright?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
It's a great song.
Thank you.
Yup.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
I understand completely.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
The Conformist.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
You haven't even seen it!
Nor have you!
Yes.  You?
I'm sure it isn't.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Whiskey.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
So you'll stay?
Yeah.
Good.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
That way.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
I'll call you.
Right.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Everything all right?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
Your lucky Laura's doing so well. If it wasn't for her, I don't think either of us would ever sleep...
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
Well call her mother.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
And after that?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
I knew this was going to happen.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
Well I don't know what happens now, apart from you meet someone, you move in, she goes.  You meet someone, you move in, she goes.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
But you must have --
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Sixty.
Thirteen hundred.
Seventy-five.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Fine.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
Well we don't.
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
No, we...
Records are those big round black things, right?
Fuck off.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Whatever.
Nice.
What's the name of your label?
Maybe he's hiding from something.
How old is Richard?
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Yeah.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
Sure.
Go to hell.
This one came unassembled.
Fine.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
Claymore.
Huh?
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
You're the expert.
It's in good condition.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
You're very macabre.
It's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
No thank you, I'm fine.
Why?
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
No.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
I don't follow you.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
The boy _died_?
Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Would you remember his name?
Carl Smith.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
-Okay okay.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Anything in Maryland is close.
Yes.
Very traditional.
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
It's not mine.
Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.
Basil the II.
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
-All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Grave robbers?
Probably.
Who?
People like that rarely leave business cards.
Does Carl Smith?
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
You have an active imagination.
I've been to Church Hill.
Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
I doubt that.  Good day, Miss Cartwright.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Why not?
Tradition.
What the hell is going on?
Where?
Dupont Circle.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
And you?
You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
He called you "MacLeod".
Not your concern.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
That bothers you?
He was innocent.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
What about me?
You?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
Have you gone to the police?
No.
You are being foolish.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
Go home.
Are you?
No.  I had to talk to you.
You're wrong.
You're a fool.
Maybe.
You've been listening to rumors.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
You are.  Now.
Not all of them.
When you finish, what then?
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
You make it all sound so simple.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Yes.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
Yes.
Well, as long as we're stuck here.
They do it each year.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
It's beautiful.
A little dusty.
Follow me.
Yes.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
At least.
That's impossible.
A factor of age.
I hope I never get that old.
You won't.
Why are you here?
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I see.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Just a little crazy.
That would be difficult to explain.
I'd like you to try.
Yes.
He knows about you.
He is older than I.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
That's insane.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
I didn't kill the watchman.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
What about that family in '31?
Sometimes innocents become involved.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.
Is that a threat?
Come here, Brenna.
Damn you.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
What is it you want?
All of it finished.
Will I see you again?
Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.
I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
No!
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
The inheritance.
Not power.  Not control.
You have lived forever.
Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.
Yes.
I'm just curious.
You're never "just curious".  You've met my neice, Brenna.
Now there's a new topic.
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
Call your mother.  You never call her.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What do you want from me?
Well, the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town.  And all of a sudden the Smithsonian's ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons.
You and I should talk first.
We've got nothing to say.
All fashionably without heads.
Spare me the details.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
What are you getting at, Moran?
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
It'll never stick.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
You're an asshole, Moran.
I want Taupin.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
What's all of this got to do with me?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
All I need is for you to check the name.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
It's that important?
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
You always were hard to impress.
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
Why?
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
-Et lux perpetua-
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
-Luceat ei-
-Auditorium nostrum-
Stop.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Stop!
Aye.
You're not from these parts.
Please go to no trouble.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
I was nearly killed.
But you lived.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
Aye.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
How can you know this?
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
Pheasant.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
Why are you here?
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
You know me home.  Me name.
It was time for our paths to cross.
You are the same?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Yes.  Always.
Does it change with me in the room?
It is less.
You feel you know me.
I don't know why.
We are brothers.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
I don't understand.
You are still so very young.
I'm twenty-two.
Not even a single lifetime.
What?
We are immortal.
No!
This is madness!
It is the truth.
No!
This can't be.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
You will live.  Survive.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
Oh my God.  Oh my God I'm lost.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
Aye.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
But we cannot be killed.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
How can I stop such a man?
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
Why?
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Me arm hurts.
Again.  Try again.
Go to hell.
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
Muy Bien!
It's like to kill me first.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
But why be so concerned about me?
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
I am not ready for this.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Of course.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
That is not me.
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
I'll be back when I can.
I have no future husband.
What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
But I did live.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Who?
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Me father has taken back my hand.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
You're not talking sense, Mara!
Do what you must.
What would you like?
Something pretty.
Like you.
Far away.
Do you have cause to bothering us?
Certainly not me.
Tradition.
It's all we have.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
No doubt.
You surprise me.  Eliminating a rival like that.  Such are the actions of a man of conquest.  I was mistaken.  300 years have turned the boy's fear into ambit- ion.
You're wrong.
Romirez is dust.
Finish yours?
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
So sure?
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Won't get it.  We are a sacrifice.  A diversion.
Not likely.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
What is your position?
Second musketeer.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
You seem to understand a great deal.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
Equals?
If you wish to play games, Major.
We have no understanding.
Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
It can be different.  It must be.
It never changes, Major.
Stay out of it.
Don't threaten me, Private.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Either you are with me or against me.
I had no choice.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
Must he go?
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Thanks.
Where did you learn that?
My father taught me.
Your father must be smart.
Yes, he was.
Yeah.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
You'd think he'd had practice.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
No.  I want this to be all ours.
I don't know.
What name is he using?
How many came?
The last four.
And the Bulgarian?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
He knows I'm here.  How?
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Kahn?
Sit.
Head still secure to the neck.
How did you find me?
How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
He always did.
-Since you last saw me.
You were never a kid.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
I've had a few more concerns.
You don't run as hard, MacLeod. You just don't run as hard anymore.
Not so long.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
MACLEOD!
Leave her out of this.
As you wish.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
Tradition.
It's all we have.
Go to hell.
Leave her alone.
Get up.
Are you here?
I want you to come to me.
Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
Should I care?
Yes.
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Did you know the victim?
No.
It doesn't.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
American.
Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
That's none of your business.
You're wrong.
I presume it's a sword.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Your murder weapon?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
A mystery.
For the moment.
Where were you Tuesday night?
Home.
A neighbor saw your car leave.
He's mistaken.
Do you?
All I need is time.
I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
Oh yes, more than enough.
His only kid.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
We were very close.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
I'll send them right up.
Same.
No.
I'm sure that's true.
Just your pappy scared some.
Why don't you fellows get your own news?
A double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
Hildy!
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
What doing?
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well, congratulations! Good luck!
What's the idea of locking this?
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Open this door!
Hello, Bensinger.
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
The poem?... The poem was great!
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
What?
No. Roy. Roy V.
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Seventy-five.
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
Sort of a Jack London style?
Exactly!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Bon jour!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
But --
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
The five hundred? Sure.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
But --
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
I lost my wallet.
Yes, wasn't it?
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Did you finish the interview?
The Criminal Courts Building.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
Hello, Bruce...
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
We'll explain the whole thing to them.
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Where'd she go?
Out some place.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Did you give her the money?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Thank you.
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
Fine.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
I'm Bruce Baldwin!
Yes!
Then who are you?

Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Oh.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
Where are we going?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
No -- she didn't.
Just wanted to surprise you, I guess.  Down!  After you, Bruce!  Come on, Hildy, my treat!
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
No. My mother.
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just for the first year.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
I don't blame them.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
I see what you mean.
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
How?
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
So long.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
That's the kind of stuff they want!
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
Say, I want to be sure, too!
You'll ask me to what?
Get out!
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys.
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
Do you want to get us scooped?
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Get out of here, you!
Your luck's not with you now!
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Out of the mouths of babes.
He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Hello, Hildy!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
I notice you still remember it.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
What home?
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
What?!!
I haven't any hard feelings.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
You can break it, can't you?
No, I can't.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
What do you mean by that?
Just what I said. That's what I --
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You've had a better offer, eh?
You bet I've got a better offer.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
I know, Walter, but I --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Listen, Walter --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
What's the matter?
Sweeney.
Dead?
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
No!
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Keep away --
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Get away, Svengali.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Please! Will you just --
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
I'm not working for any other paper!
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
Look at this!
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Where'd you meet this man?
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
He's in the insurance business.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Thanks...
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Say, could I meet him?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
You're not afraid, are you?
Afraid? I should say not!
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
Now you got me.
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
No kidding?
What for?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thanks.
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
Thank you.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
You said it.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
What do you mean?
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
We're not interested.
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
What tricks would I pull?
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind that. What's the story?
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
Hold on a minute.
Yes. Where is he?
She jumped out of the window.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
I know, but --
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald!
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
I'd like to think.
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
I get it!
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
Huh!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
How much do you want on it?
All the words you've got.
Where's some paper?
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Okay, Walter.
All right, Walter.
Where's Butch?
Where's Bruce?
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
What tickets?
Is he coming back here?
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
I'm finished.
Finished!
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
What did you do with her?
What happened?
You been in a fight?
Louie!
Was she? Did you notice?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Is this the Community Hospital?
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Will you come here?
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Yes.
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
What is it? Here!
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Murder, uh?
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Who did you talk to?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
Don't tell me you were worried!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
In a way.
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Flip a coin.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
Then why are you doing it?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Where'd you wire him?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Sure.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What would you do if it was a daughter?
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
Now don't argue, Hildy.  How about it, Judge?
You're not fooling anybody.
Walter, you can't do that!
Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him!  "With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
It'll be Heaven!
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
You -- you!!
What's that -- what's that?
You know you did!
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
You grey-haired old Judas!
Let me out! Let me out of here!
Take that mush out of your mouth!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Who do you want?
You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
I always have both.
I'm busy, Duffy.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
What?
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
They can't do that to me!
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
No more interviews. Besides, a doctor's coming over.
I think it is.
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
It's a deal. Let me up.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
You said it!
They're always after me for interviews.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
Yes, sir.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Point the gun at me!
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Three bullets! Any good?
Beats king up.
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
All right -- all right!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
What have you got, Hildy?
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Call you back.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Who engineered this getaway?
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun.  Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
I'll have it in a minute.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
So long, Hildy.
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Now, where is he?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
I can't complain.
Little rum in yours, too?
I guess so.
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Good coffee, isn't it?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
Hold her, boys!
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
What do I know about Williams?
All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Not this gun!
What?
With a bag of marshmallows.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
What went off?
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
After all I've done for you --
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
Yeah. But I --
No, I couldn't do that.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.
What do you mean -- through?
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
Fred!
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
If there was any way out...
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
An attempt to ruin us!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Ah, Fred --  Hello... this is Hartman --
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
What is it?
They got him!  Wait a minute -- hold the wire.  They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
I did.  Hold the wire.
Cover up that transmitter!
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Now what do you say?
Just -- one -- second!
Shoot to kill, I said.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
A sight for sore eyes!
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
I never saw him before!
I was just going to!
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
I won't.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Go on -- shoot me!
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Now, Hildy --
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
I can't.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Five hundred dollars.
You'll take fifty and like it!
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
Editorials?
My name is Louis Peluso.
I'm telling you!
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
What did you do with her?
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
All right, Judge.
Phone for you, Hildy.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
Give me that!
I'll go right after it.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
And up a dime.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
I thought so, too.
No -- what?
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Come on with that money!
First you got to sign a receipt.
Where's the money?
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Huh?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Mother!
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
That man there!
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
What are your beliefs, Earl?
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Very simple, Earl.
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Isn't that her picture?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
I won't, Earl.
Put down that gun, Earl.
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Keep away!
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
Sure I do, Earl.
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
They're not human!
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
What do you mean?
Quiet, Mollie!
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
Ssh!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Shut up, you!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
What's from the Governor?
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Get the Governor on the phone!
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
How much do you make a week?
Huh?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Forty dollars.
Who do you think!
The what?
The City Sealer's office!
You mean here in the city?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
For heaven's sake, why not?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
Yeah?
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
But how do I know...?
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
Pinkus.
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Is it hard?
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
You can't bribe me!
You're insane!
A very fine-looking women.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
Hello, Mollie.
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
Come on, fellas.
Say, Hildy...
We want to see you.
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
What's he want?
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
She and Mollie were talking.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
I know.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
Why?
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
But Grandpa, you said...
I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
Very well, Grandpa.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Only till they get you into the local school.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
Apparently so.
No, she didn't.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
Looking for shrapnel.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
What's that?
Who told you that?
They're not.
I don't mind.
Do you know any swear words?
Yes.
Say them.
I only know one.
Bugger off.
Sod.
Sod.
Bloody.
Bloody.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Bugger off, you bloody sod.
OK. You're in.
Won't they have maps?
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
You wouldn't.
Would.
You couldn't.
Could.
Ask her yourself.
Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
We thought it was poison.
Who with?
Pauline.
Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how.
He's the worst liar.
...and four and five...
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
...and six...
They've got the real thing outside.
It's not the same.
It's Canadian. Where'd you get it?
You don't like jam. You hate jam. You never eat jam.
That's not the point.
Well, for the baby, really.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
The sodding water table.
It's like telling fibs.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
Wow!
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Who pays for them?
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
A bit too quick.
They might be.
I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Air-raid?
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
Where?
I don't know?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
I swear I don't know.  Here's your Christmas present.
Please yourself.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Kiss me Hardy.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Why not?
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Propaganda. We've been had.
Except the servicemen.
Naturally.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
Bugger the Buffs.
I will if you will!
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
And absent bridegrooms!
And the bride.
They'd gone.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
What's that?
You joined up.
Oh, that.
I wish you could have told me yourself.  Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
Jam.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
It looks....foreign.
Jam is jam! It's just jam!
You taste it.
That's it.
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
What are you going to be then?
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Where to?
Fair enough.  The river.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
Just ignore her, Mac.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
After this dance.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
The ideas you get in your head.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
Out.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
No, I won't.
There, there, my baby.
Who said anything about love?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
It's not. It's happening to me.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Or what?
Up to six weeks, I think.
How are we going to cope?
Wasn't it lovely?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Grace!
Play something, Grace.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
You might still have a house.
I wish it could all have been different.
Father, that's enough now
And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
How long?
And now we're glad you did.
My aunt in Australia has offered..
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I know you mean well.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Am I? Maybe I am.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Really, that's a long time.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yikes.
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
What?
Cone.
Huh... what cone?
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Cool.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
What about R.J.?
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Baby! Stop!
No, I told you...
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
Who's your Daddy!
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Where's that?
Oh yeah, the tree.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
Come on.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Well, yeah, kind of.
OK.
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Is your brother ready to go?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Yeah, come on.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
You're welcome.
A dead one.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
That's not something to joke about.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
Nice.
I was just wondering.
Wondering what?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
What?
You know... a couple of queers.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Fucking great.
You shouldn't a done that.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
Now, what makes you think that?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Great story Goober, how much?
Holy crap, thanks!
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
The Duke?
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
You mean John Wayne?
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
I don't drive cross country.
But if you did.
But suppose for a second you did.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
She's pretty cute.
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Yeah, no shit.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Yeah.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
Perfect.
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
OK, Boss.
How awesome?
Really fucking awesome.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Hell yeah.
How much further?
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
I don't know.
What's that?
Way out here?
Cat fight, cat fight.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
I'll help ya.
Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Thanks.
No problem.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Tasted pretty good.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
Here he comes.
He won't move.
Turn that fucking radio off!
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Yeah, showtime for what?
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Man, it's already ten thirty.
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
Lock the fucking doors.
It's a girl.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
She looks like a freak.
Where ya headed?
There's a dog in the road.
There's not enough room.
Then run him over, he'll move.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
What?
What!
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
Quiet.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
Drive through it!
It won't work.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
Is that all... think real hard.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
How's about you give me those same directions.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Enough talk, write.
Hmmmmm.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
What?
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Goddamn.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
I hear ya.
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
That's nice.
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
He should be back in a couple hours.
How's he get around out here?
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Oh.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Tickets for what?
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
I don't want to see that.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
That seems likely.
Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
So.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Why?
Yeah?
So what?
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
When you were outside with Bill.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Dude, your chick's a little high strung.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
This isn't funny, it's twisted.
Shhhhhh.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Help, help us.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
Well, just promise me you'll be careful... alright, alright see ya soon... good-bye.
Sleeping.
Rise and shine.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
I resign.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Tell me about it.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.

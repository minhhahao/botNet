The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I did.
What?
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
And where're you going?
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Just sent 'em through.
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Don't make me do it, man
She's partial to Joey, not me
Are you lost?
We don't chat.
That's never been proven
Who cares?
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
I know a lot more than that
Seven-thirty?
Why, don't you?
Sure, I do
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Maybe.
I'm gettin' there
BIANCA
What are you doing here?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Acting the way we do.
I hate peas.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Right.
Kat a fan, too?
We're your guys.
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Your life, and that of others!
If they agree to follow me, yes.
I know.
I don't want you to wait for me.
You don't usually ask.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
All of them created by people like me.
Ask him if he will help.
How did you manage it?
So was Christ!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
What did they say about Granada before today?
A woman?
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
God be with us admiral.
Immediately.
We're lost!
The land is there.  I know it!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
Oh, sure.
What about Oleg?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Give me another one, please.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Your mother was blind?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
I'm sorry.
I'll make some for us.
Go on.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
But Chief?  Over this??
You ready?
A timer.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Stay with her.
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Hmmmm.
Who says she's a suspect?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Hey.  I'm a professional.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
What do you want?
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
Hey.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
I am butcher.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Tommy, take a walk.
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
You said speak Czech!
Don't want to film this?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Did you hurt her?
It's easy to learn.
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
What are you coming here to do?
Excuse me?
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Clean?
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Not good.
What the hell happened?
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
Sure, what is it?
Really.
That seems very unlikely.
That's true.
But not completely inconceivable?
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Well, what is it?
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
In three days, darling, I hope.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Well, I'm glad about that.
Certainly.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
True.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
Must be billy's girl.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
They saved your ass, convict.
He's after your money.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
No class...
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Jack?
Yeah?
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Shit.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Nothing.
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Call me later.
Guess people ought to know who I am...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Jack, wait...
That's no bull.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
We got a lot to talk about.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
Five bills.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Corn-i-Lius?
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
You little sleaze bag!
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Got it...
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
What is it?
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Oh, yes you will...
Uh...
...Hoppi-hoppa.
You noticed..
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Recommendations.
Gentlemen?
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Got it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Why the gun?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
Amy...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Dino...
I promised him to Machine.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
You betrayed us.
I figured you share information.
Why don't they come to me?
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Eddie.
I told you, I don't know.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
I try to be.
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
It won't work like that.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Fine...
These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations...  ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different.  I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually.  I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
I didn't mean to...
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
Who is this... ?
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
Certainly, sir.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
It was bad.
Great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
What?
Then you saw him, too?
You're his sister, right?
Three days.
You just feel sorry for me.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
Who said I...wait, what?
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
To take a picture.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
So did Dan.
I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
That's their problem.
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Mark...
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
I don't know.
So they caught up with you, too?
Right, Skipper.
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Who with?
That's what I said!
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Obviously.
Toward the Pole!
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Oh.
Yeah.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
You can't buy Wade off.
That was me.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Really.
They said.
Sun's gettin high.
What blood?
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
What?
Saw him do it?
Yeah.
Can't you see... look out there. Nobody's got their porch lights on anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt kids are just out to get in trouble. See, they put shaving cream all over that mailbox there. They chopped down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little bastards. Jesus H. Christ.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
I called Mommy.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Yes.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Fine.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
I figured you already heard.
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Like hell.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Could be.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Hi honey.
You okay?
Yeah.
Said what?
Jack doesn't need money.
But not now.
Then... I guess you have to.
Oh, Wade.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Hold on!
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
His office. You mean my old office.
Atta-go.
Wade?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Not particularly.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Yes dear?
I'm sorry I was so mean to you earlier.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Got it.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
You read my mind.
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
Got it.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Roger.
Any of us?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
A dubious distinction, no?
You'll do it?
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
What?
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Please... don't start with me.
The fax machines.
We're under attack.
Where's my family?
Yeah, right.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
Other way around, sir.
Sir...
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
What's the story?
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Elaine, we have to go back.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
I think so.
Roger.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Can I hold him?
Yeah.
What?
A b...
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Do you have an appointment, sir?
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
A hospital? What is it?
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
But if you'll just give me...
I love you.
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
And a little ice.
Who wants to be first?
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Huh?
No, why don't you take care ot it?
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
That's right.  He and I, along with seven or eight others.  Listen, gentlemen, I will be happy to assist you in any way I can -- unfortunately, at the moment, I'm overdue at another function.
Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
That is exactly so.  It is like your name... Sykes.  I'm sure it doesn't bother you at all that it sounds like "ss'ai k'ss", two words in my language which mean "excrement" and "cranium".
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Nothing?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
Stay back!  I'm okay.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
You are married?
I appreciate your honesty, George.
Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
You understand that.  But how many others will?
No... two.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
Can't lock up...
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
In seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.
You are a head case.  Have a donut.
That's right.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Bullshit!
You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
What's the question?
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
Are you finished?  You okay?
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Fuck you.
You're just reading me.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
Uh, what's next?
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Just get back here!
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
I know, honey.  Me too.
Indeed.
What's that?
A brothel.
You might be disappointed.
What did you think of the music?
Meaning you didn't like it.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
Fartsbishop!
Why not?
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Yes.
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
No one.
Give me two more weeks. Please.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Then he didn't send you?
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
Not at all.
Money! Money!
Be careful!
Adorable!
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
May I try it?
And the result satisfies.
Well. There it is.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Yes, indeed.
Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably!
Twenty-six.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
I will.
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
It couldn't be better.
How many pupils do you have?
This one will.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
I will, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Do any pupils come to the house?
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
Yes what?
Is he working?
Is he working?
Are you sure it's an opera?
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
My answer is no, Mozart.
Mio caro Adone.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
You mean she's not coming back?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
Sing it back.
Do you have it?
I think you'd better.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
No, but I'm the best.
Mozart -
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
So?
Leave me alone.
How well are you trained in music?
Then you must know this.
I regret it is not too familiar.
And do they believe it?
Yes.
Exactly.
You must be mad.
I've seen the manuscript.
Where?
Incredible.
Ballet? What ballet?
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Can we come in?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Yes, Doctor?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
What happened to them?
Yes, I believe he did.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
What did he say?
Warn him?
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Tea would be nice.
David?
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Aw come on, Alex!
That's not really a very proper question.
Twenty-eight.
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Not just a patient -- me.
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
I would think so.
Lovely.
Anything.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
There's no call for that kind of language.
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
No, but we're about to.
Oh, come on, tell us.
Where am I?
You're in a hospital in London.
I really don't know.
She's a jerk.
You're talking about the woman I love.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
I'm not listening!
Shut up, you zombie!
Stop it, Jack.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
You must believe me.
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
No.
And what, Sergeant?
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Take it easy, Clark.
Just pure luck!
Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
What about?
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Fifty thousand dollars!
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
know, but—
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
I want to be near you!
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
Now?
I'm listening.
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Why - well, I—
Yes, sir.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Now don't you worry about it.
All right. Send him in.
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
Yes, sir.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Is it safe?
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
I'm afraid so.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
All right.
With what?
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
Dude Finlay?
Yes.
I guess so.
Never a good thing.
I ain't done --
... Will Perry ...
We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
Hey!
What?
How?
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
So what do we do, General Lee?
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
You're forgetting who's in charge --
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
That's it.
And I'm the better outlaw.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
You ride like a Comanche.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
I think he's already feeling better.
So we got a plan?
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
Maybe, maybe...
Don't care.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
Can't argue that.
Boys?
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Little ones.
Yes ma'am.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Yes?
Thanks.
I think so.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
I can completely understand your distress, sir.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
No.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
I can't.
You like it there, don't you?
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
Pull out.
Turn the light on.
Maybe.
Alright.
Really?
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
He's rich.
Everybody has a great body now.
No. I'm not. Why should I ?
It's not.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Nice.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
No, you...didn't?
Commes des Garcon.
Jesus lives, Luis.
I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something.
Thanks, Patrick.
Oh no. I have no plans.
You didn't give them a name.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Sorry. 
Jean? What?
Jean-I'm not-
No.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Oh.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Nothing.
Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Not a big music fan, eh?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
But Marcus denied it?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Yes.
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Another Martini, Paul?
'Gonna wait outside.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
We're not gonna let it.
I know, I know.
Isn't that -- extreme?
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
What're you -- what?
I remember.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
It's gonna get cold.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
Sure, I'll see what I can do.
Is it your dish?
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Skywire.
Talk about work? Never!
I'm okay. It's going well!
Sure.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Maybe we should all get on it.
Longitude 109 --
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Why's that?
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
He's out of prison?
What?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
I could get it out of him.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
Smashing!
Good luck, Austin.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
Why? What's wrong with my teeth?
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
Oh, yes you are.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Who?
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
I love you, Austin.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
What are you saying, son?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet. Excuse me.
Yes.
Right.
They're mutated sea bass.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Yeah. What?
Show me.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
You didn't...
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
Peter ...
Ah, but you haven't see the real me. Watch closely ...
Rules are made to be broken.
Then who wins?
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
So am I.
Thanks, Valentine ...
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
An unholy trinity ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
And I suppose you're the knight.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
As per mother's instructions.
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
Very good, Steed ...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
To kill me?
Winning isn't everything.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Shall we?
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Pity your mother came, too ...
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Makes two of us.
How did you guess?
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
Anyone particular in mind?
Perish the thought.
Did I? My mistake.
Women!
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
No.
I'm marrying Debbie.
The best.
Maybe it had something to do.
Yes I did.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
I'm going now, Cole.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Can't I just go with you guys?
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
You're on.
You're so romantic...
Ilene, are you crazy?
Any time, Al.
Screw that.
Yes.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
I just want to be alone.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
All right, who serves?
Oh, no!
The phone made me do it!
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I'm proud of you, lad.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
I'm saved. Let's party!
What's with her costume?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Right... Think it over.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
Thanks for the speakers.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Everybody did.
Shut up!
Huh.
I seem to remember some pretty good nights on JP II.
How's it going?
Uh huh.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
So you came to me...  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all...
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
See you Monday. Sir.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Pest control.
No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
Nice bunch of guys.
Hi, Helen. Man, you look great.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
And DIE!
Firehouse.
I'm busy.
I'll be there.
Fixing my roof.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
The great communicator.
Yeah? When was the last time?
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
And old ladies?
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
Don't you have any leads at all?
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
Who?
Yes.
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Don't bullshit me.
Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
How 'bout...
I'm on it.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
What do you do?
I'm a revolutionary.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
You ain't happy about the green light?
Look at my lips.
So that's what you been doing?
De-la-croix.
How much?
Did we get our bill yet?
And I'm the feet.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
EUREKA!!
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
To what?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
I'm wid it.
Go away, unless you got my money.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
Is that so?
Nobody told me anything.
Manray!
What point is that?
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Sounds risky to me.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Do you have to be so damn forthright?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
Same thing Giuliani said.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Soon.
What's a Negro.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
The best defense is offense.
You've never had any formal training, either?
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
You tellin' the truth.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
We should go out on a double date.
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
You slept too near where you got in?
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
And what?
Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
It must have been some other gate.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Is Miss Dugan well?
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
For whom else have you worked?
Only the agency of servants.
I have faced that problem before.
Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
Not one.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
Agreed.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
I see.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Tender Hegenheim.
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
You saw West's body.
But not Pike's.
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Would you have believed me?
Can't do that now, though, can you?
The rest of you, fallout for physicals!
West's. Any kindling for afire?
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Oh, come on --
That's exactly what he says about you.
This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
Tell me what I can do.
And the problem is you only got three.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
Get your hands away from the desk!
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Something like that.
Not the happiest of memories?
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
I don't know.
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Seven.
I don't think I want to hear this --
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
He whispered it in my ear.
Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
You can't threaten me --
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Fine, I will.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
No.
Eighteen.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
I never knew.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
You know where the chemicals are?
Dad!
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
The river?
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
They're your favorite flower.
There is no softer ground than town.
I'm robbing this place.
Hello.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
Did you?
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
What for?
No I don't.
Name it.
What are you doing here?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
Yes. I know.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
What?
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
No. It's not that.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
You can stay tonight.
Good night.
Leave her alone.
What's wrong?
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Well as it turns out I did.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I said I don't have any.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
I wasn't saying anything.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
Well what have you got?
No. What? No. I know.
Tell me about it.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Sure.
You been home yet?
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
I got others.
I bet you did. Just had to get that black cock up in you. I swear to God. What Ronnie sees... you disgust me.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Yeah.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
Come on, gal...
Two days?
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
What?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Let go of me...
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
I can handle that.
Well, get to it.
Sure.
Anything.
The... chain helps.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
I guess you have.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
Looks like you know a song.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
What'chu sayin'?
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
Why's his britches round his knees?
Ain't gonna be moved?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
This all looks wonderful.
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
Rae...
Holy shit!
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
The Wolf?
Where is the subway station, please.
I said let's go, Charlie.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
All right, how's the new partner?
Why the hell not?
Yeah...
I'll get him for you, Nick.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I don't give tours.
He's on duty.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
He's got a reason.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
Why would you care?
What if I chant?
Save it, I already took the tour.
She's such a long way home for you.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
I'll pay you.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
After a court convicts him.  He belongs to me.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
Death.
Like what?
He could?
This afternoon.
Hello, glad to meet you.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Yeah.  I got it.
Next.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Vodka!
Ya.
I don't know.
Sorry.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
You sure?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
I've already got more help than I need.
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
Black?
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Sitting next to you.
The machine works.  She is.
Don't move.
What desert?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
Yes?
Bravo!
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
Here, pick these up!
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
Do you own a car?
Yes.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
I haven't brushed yet.
Watching television in color.
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Two weeks.
My Mom and Dad.
This is for me.
What for?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
I like it.
What?!
Uh...yeah.
Yeah.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Not that one!
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Maybe. But that's how it works.
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Goodnight!
My pleasure.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No kidding!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Yes, sir. It's true.
Not particularly.
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
It's so small.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
I'm not wearing his pants.
The recovery is very impressive.
Yeah...Seems to.
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Say what?!
Hi.
Really? No kidding?
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
I just hope this is still good up there.
No.
Yes.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
Yeah.
Good god.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
Well, put it down and come in!
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
Yes, dear!
To you maybe.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
I told you! I've got everything!
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Honey?
I've noticed.
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
If I...you know...
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Yes...
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
--and we will--
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
Yes, dear, I know.
I thought ten years.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
That's what I'm sensing.
What do you think, Adam?
I think...it...works.
He's from Alaska.
Uh..he might of.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Those sluts!
To bed.
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Um...uh...
Roger, Wolf One.
Yeah. How's Dad?
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Okay.
Yeah.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Jeffrey nothing.
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
What do you want?
See my nipples?
Yes.
What?
No.
You don't?
OK.
Please, please stay.
Hello.
No police!!!  No police!!
Yes.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Just get outta my bed.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
You called me Jeffrey.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Hello, daddy.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
No thanks. What does that mean?
Good, let's drink up.
Yeah. okay.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
That sounds great!
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Hey Jeff.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
OK.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Okay, okay. Bye.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
Goodnight.
See ya tomorrow.
What am I going to do?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Jeffrey!!
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Go ahead.
Sandy?
No Jeffrey!!
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
Get a hold of yourself, man.
What are you saying?
He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
I know what the fuck he looks like!
We paid attention in school.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Aye.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
Italian.
No pictures, either.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Just like on TV.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Aye.
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
And he is one smart man.
We do not want your tired and sick.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
Just called ta torture us did ya?
We promise.
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
I mean he ain't here.
God's permission? God doesn't...
Yes.
Forgive me father.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Have you no fear of God?
The... The funny man.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Making Hutch David Soul?
No. It's a real episode. The killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
He says. This is he.
No. This is he.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
Yeah, I saw it.
Yeah, I heard that.
Eight dollars.
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
Dignan! Stop!
You're right. You're right.
Where's the other stocker?
OK. Go ahead.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
Hi.
No kidding.
Where was it parked?
If you say so.
Would of been nice.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
We've got sixteen dollars.
I know that. But --
What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Let me feel that.
OK. Mark that down.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
Where's Kumar?
I don't know.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
I'm not kidding.
Oh, I'd say about --
Dignan, I --
Thanks.
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
Yes, he did.
That sounds like Dignan.
Yeah.
See you, Bob.
I hope not.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Why do you say that?
No. I wasn't adopted.
Who's got the car keys?
It could happen. This is the exact kind of place where it happens. But I don't want to scare you.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Hell, no. This is a '72. I was driving a '63 Pontiac.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
You're the faggot.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
I warned you, Dignan.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
What are you talking about?
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
What is it?
Not a whole lot, Bob.
Bob, you're lying!
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
Why?
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
No, my friend knows her.
Where's your friend? He go with the chiquita?
Good to know you, John.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Excuse me.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
Why not? It was just money.
And Danny Zorn, what was that?
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Yes...
Sorry. Old habits.
Who sent you to Greece?
What's going on in Berlin?
No. There's nothing new.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
I worry when you get like this.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
But it ends up the same.
Where --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
-- not yet --
There must be another way!
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Get on it.
I want to hear it from you.
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
Your first assignment was Geneva.
Bourne?
Sounds like a threat.
I'm working on it.
And the Germans can't match it?
Who's going? Us?
Is there. Is all there.
We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
Me? Four years.
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Amnesia?
Believed what?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
We must sue for peace.
It is suicide.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Aye.
It's up to us, Hamish!
Humbly, M'lord.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
I'm not just saying it!
This night is too beautiful to have again.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
...I wouldn't know.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
So what did you find.
Okay.
I... I blacked out.
Sure...
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Are you hurting her?
I see a car.
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
I dunno.  Just being weird.
Go on. Sit down.
Like how?
He's a fucking maniac!
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
I don't get it.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Meant no offense.
Sorry. Never heard of her.
Oh my God oh my God...
Oh, yes.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
But Richard, no, I, I --
But what about us?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
I will, don't worry.
No, Victor, no.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Won't you join us for a drink?
What for?
We all try. You succeed.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
My office.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
But we made a deal.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Very well.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
What else, my dear Major?
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Our entertainment is enough.
Victor Laszlo.
He'll take one.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
-- Thanks. I will.
What friend?
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Go ahead, Ricky.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Is everything ready?
Sacha, she's had enough.
I'm a drunkard.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
No. Not me, boss.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
Nothing out there but ocean.
No.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Well, I do a little drawing --
Well, not really, I --
Had a package to deliver.
And for you --
You want to.
I can't take him to work.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
I didn't know what really being alone was.  No one back here does.
You too.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
I most definitely say I am.
The place is falling apart.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
But I might not have.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
It's me.
Believe me I know.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
No sweat.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
I'm *not* a doctor!
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Good night, Daddy.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Where's Mandalay?
Burma!
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
Right.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
Well, we have to help her!
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
Please don't...
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
She looks after other people's children.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
It's okay--I don't mind.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
I don't think so.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
What you got a picture of your heart for?
So what?
Now, now. He's a good boy.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
Ten percent. Of how much?
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
Gee... What makes you say that?
That's not a bad place to start.
And these cops? What do they get?
You know when the first con was ever played? It was when Adam fell for Eve in the Garden of Eden.
It's not true.
Calls?
That's it.
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I can't do that.
Come here!
Harder. Remember, I killed your buddy.
Great. Thank you.
I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
I'll worry about Customs.
It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
What about the money?
I'm going to say this one last time for you, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
I'm sorry.
This is embarrassing.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
Pretty much.
It's not history.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
What's the Blue Book price?
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Eight-fifty.
Turn around.
It came my way. 450 a week.
I had training. In the Republic.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
What about a drink on the way home?
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
I hope it brings you luck.
Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit!
Not talking. Writing.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
What?
No.
You know where I'm from?
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
Absolutely not.
Just an accident. Nothing.
That's fine.
I didn't.
I owe a lot of money.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
Jack! It's Jani.
Ross.
You did?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm not going to report it.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
And the girls?
That bitch? No.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
We do. 
They've been tested.
I make it six.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Fine.
Does he win?
Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
What flickering light?
I hope it's not the oven again.
Look, bomb...
Key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Talby, can you read me?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Thanks.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
To explode, of course.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
What happened, Doolittle?
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Bruno's girlfriend.
Yeah.
No... Cause tonight the girls are here in a more or less professional capacity. All of them work for me, and you don't... Let's go.
Guess again.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
What're you talkin' about?
How come I never hearda you before?
None of your business.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
Hello...
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Yes on all counts.
The other ones?
The other one like you...
You lost me.
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
A nuclear airburst wipes out every record of every kind in every computer east of the Rockies, and you want me to find some woman you met when you were seven, whose last name you don't even know... Maybe if you could give me something more on her...anything you can remember, some detail...
How's this about me?
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
What?
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
And because he's my friend.
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Later.
We gotta talk.
Max--
But there's another side--
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
Does this person have a name?
What happens if you level with her?
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
Easy Sketchy.
I want you on call here.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Pick a song, Hawk.
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
Believe it.
Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
I've been in love with her since the second grade.
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
Curly.
No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?
Sure.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
That's it?
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
Let's lift up her shirt.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
Not if I shoot first!
What happened?
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Donnie, I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Until it withers away.
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
What?
What do you mean?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey. You OK?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
His name is Frank.
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
Follow him where?
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
Can anyone else see him?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Where is he, Donald?
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Yeah.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Gerald.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
Oh-yah.
Really, Loretta?
This came for you, sweetie.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong...
Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
You heard me. Where is it?
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
So? Be real easy.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
What?
The bitch.
And the year before that?
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Gladys! Stop it!
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
Half watch dog?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
What other job you got?
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
I don't wanna work at all.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
What did you say to her?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
You upstart!
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
For you, I would do anything... 
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
I thought everything was working out fine.
I'll join you shortly.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
No, I think a whiskey.
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
That I am very little different from him.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
...Yes, Sir.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
I don't understand.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Romance!
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
y-y-yes--
Where did you get this box?
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
My... name is...
We do have a lot to talk about, don't we?
Thank you very much.
How is your tea, John?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
I've heard.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Very smart indeed.
YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
Never mind. I'm the owner.
What are what?
Those things in your hands.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
"The fifth one this week"!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Who?
But, Erik...
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Of course.
There is something I must ask the Gods...
No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return.
What d'you mean?
They will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
Is it night or day, Erik?
I'm sure it's lovely.
But you don't want to hear it.
Yes... oh, yes...
You don't love ME.
Well you started it.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Ah.
I don't know! I just did!
It saved my father!
He wants to KILL us.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Oh... er... yes...
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
What's the matter with Bjorn?
How about making friends?
DEATH!
She MUST have a knife or something...
I have to go...
You're wasting your time.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
I... I...
Get away, Snorri.
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
Well... I... I thought...
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
So did your father...
Not now, Sven...
Dad!
You liar!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Tell him I'm coming!
I never do...
You did? You liked me?
I was not.
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Why what?
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I don't really know how --
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
What?
I don't know.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Okay.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
Would you get me another, Joely?
I want to know you.
Oh?
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
I don't know.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
Really? Is he cute?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
We did talk about Naomi.
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
Come up and see me... now.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I know.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I love her.
Seems too coincidental that way.
It's dark.
I think we should go.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
I'm nervous, too.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
I don't know.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
You must have been crazy.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
'kay.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Where?
You better go.
Nothing.
Then why did you ask me?
You are such a sweetheart.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Yeah.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
You don't?
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
You bet your raggedy white ass I am.
I was a successful model once.
Tired...
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
Coop, where are you...
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
Can you shut it down?
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
"Another man?" Who?
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
It gets worse.
Nothing. It's nothing.
Pressure?
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
Some things you don't get over.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
I built it.
Justin.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Thanks.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
The date.
What about it?
Yes...
You know.
One-four degrees...
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Yes, sir.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
That's enough!
How much oh-two do we have?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
I've got a theory.
I'm going outside to work on the Clark. And Starck... don't tell anyone what you just told me. We've got enough to worry about.
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Yes.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
I mean...
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
It's easy for you to be patient.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Baby, you're scaring me.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Solid.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Yeah, nine years straight.
Got it, teach.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Give me a mirror...
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Please tell me you go silent too.
It's been changed.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
That's good. That's uh... good.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
What? What do you mean you --
What in the world would give me that idea?
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
I gave him twenty.
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
I understand the business reasons.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
You can't leave them out there.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Susan. What are you doing?
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
You're fired.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Sure. Come on in.
No. Are you crazy?
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Did you get her name?
I would. Yeah.
There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
Mark. What happened to your date?
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Not if you're over sixteen.
I don't go at all.
Fascinating.
That's me, Merv.
Then don't hassle it.
Suzanne Somers' tits.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
He was hot, wasn't he?
If I didn't have a fiancé in Chicago, I'd go for it.
I know.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
It couldn't be.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
He's not coming.
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
Well, you'll find out next year.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
How about your phone number?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
The point sounds fine.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Do you want to come inside?
What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Not for me.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Well, thank you.
Naw! Not a major.
Hell, no!
Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
Jesus! Did I say that?
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
You whore!
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
I want to leave fast.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
NO! Stop talking like that.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
This is a fucking nightmare.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
Oh, come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
With what just happened upstairs --
Look.
Yep.
Oh.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
Holds four.
Seven.
Seven.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
F-f-fuck you.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Gimme the keys.
MOVE YOUR ASS!
GO-GO-GO!!
That's one piece of four problems.
Right.
Well...
'Forgive'...? For What?
You're afraid!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Come here. I want to show you something.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
An actress.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
...Yes.
Without me.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
Were you a drug addict?
Be careful, Francie.
Thank you.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Good.
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
I wouldn't miss it.
Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
Are you really serious? About acting?
Why?
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Not me. But other people seem to.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Came to get a tan.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Forget it.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
What's left of my blood.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
How did I look?
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
The speech? Real good.
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Then why did you bring them?
What's wrong?
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
I will, I promise.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Oh bullshit.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
It ain't for lack of trying.
Please sit down...
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
I see.
...Did you really say that?
Stay calm, please.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Frances, I'm warning you...
Sedate her.
No!
No! No!
'Incurable.'
I was watching.
Then why weep for him?
The music? Or the fire?
I am afraid.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Friend?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
There, there... shhh...
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  Fellow..."
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
Not as weak as I.
So do I.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
A... week?
Thank you, Henry.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
I don't know.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Wet. I don't know.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
I meant everything.
Let's go back, Barry...
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Okay, Fireman.
Aw.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
I'm exhausted.
What about Kate?
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Yes, they do.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
Kate, Scott?
Ain't it the truth.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Everybody goes home!
Sure.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
He didn't recognize shit.
Feels good.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
All I'm saying --
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
Seth, if you were me --
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
I did?
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
What?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
Okay, I'll have one.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
West?
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Uh, question, ma'am.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Absolutely not.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
I'm sure it is.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
Sir?
You're wanted at the C.O.'s.
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not?
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
This has nothing to do with you.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Which is guy-speak for...
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
How hard they making it on you?
Me?  Why me?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
What about him.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
You're kind of a surprise yourself.
Last time I didn't.
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
Say again?  How many micks?
15, sir.
MOVE!
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
We are so fucked.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
The first female President?
Women.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
I take it this file is still open.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
What?
Yeah, well...
What else do you know about it?
Nesting?
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
You're kidding, right?
And you're beautiful...
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
It's Tatopoulos.
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
Oh.
We, have already taken care of them.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
So you're in?
How do I do that?
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Nothing.
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
You have a better plan, Alex?
Why didn't you stop at the market?
Oh.  Okay.
We'd better get everybody online.  And Kyle, Stop downloading porn.  Your frame rate is unacceptable.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left.
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
What do you mean?
Lt. Madison, GO.
What?  Up?
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
We're getting major structural damage.
What's the weather like outside?
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
Maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
Where'd they go? Back inside?
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Will you stop RIDING ME?!
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Right.
I can't...  It's on autopilot!...
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
I... certainly, but-
Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender!
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Pedal to the metal...
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Marquis!  Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
To hell with Arnold...
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
General Lee is detained captain...
We already have black soldiers in our army...
They help me understand why we fight.
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
I... they look both the same.
You must be very rich.
And how rusty are these muskets?
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
We're leaving them?
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
I'd throw everything away for you.
Africa, of course.
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
Juba was a Numidian.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
I guess still in the locker.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Calm down? We're going away for life and you tell me to calm down?
I have to ask you for that key.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
She can't talk right now.
I'll find it.
It's a different kind of deal.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
It's not the kind of thing you do.
That's the magic number.
Depends. Who's this?
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Something shouldn't be there.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
For a movie?
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You don't even know these guys.
Let's see how we get along.
You're kidding, right?
I had to tell 'em something.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
You have it?
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
He died.
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
I'm thinking of a movie.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Like this?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
It's all mine.
Maybe you don't see my sign?
What're you doing here?
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
I want to know.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
Depends, who pays?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Go get your stuff.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
I'm going.
Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
That's what it says.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
Wrong. It's Friday.
What?
Yeah.
No.
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
Seen a lota movies.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
Sounds reasonable.
Turbine rotor's shot.
Three, four days.
It looks like it.
How about you Epps?
If they knew what they were carrying.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
There's a charming thought.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Because of the gold.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
You just shoot at something?
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
Only something must've gone wrong.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
Just lucky I guess.
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
Drink up then.
Say what?
What's this?
Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
Give up?
Are you still looking for a job?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
Hello...
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Did you actually do this painting?
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
Help me what?
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Can I come in?
Yeah, right...
Okay... I promise.
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
As always.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
Should we leave a note?
It'll only take a second.
Wait...
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
No, really...
Don't you want nice stuff?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
How repulsive!
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. 
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Well, we won't keep you.
Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
Get a job!
Yes.
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Hey, I was only kidding!
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
I really didn't get a good look at her.
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one...  Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
I don't think so...
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
So, what happened?
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
Do you have anything to drink?
Jesus, how can you stand her?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Why? What did she tell you?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
-careful, Abdullah-
So work must be going well?
Genius- the beast will enter, tripping the wire, the door will slide down, trapping him, you, safe behind the bars, will have him at your mercy and will shoot him.
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain.
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?
That's very considerate.
I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
You- they cannot believe you're still here.
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
I expect so- it's from my wife.
You give me hope, John. 
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Does he ever mention me?
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
Okay, that's no problem.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Good luck.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
Ghostbusters.
Oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
Tonight?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.

My pleasure.
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
Good idea.
What's the reading?
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
So we'll put a warning on the label.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Well, thanks a lot.
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
Ummm -- figure eight?
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
No.  They're just coming to me.
Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
Eight o'clock?
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
... I thought it was the drug store.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
Well, let's check it out.
I know.  It happened by itself.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
That would definitely explain it.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
What is it?
Thank you.
I'm not at liberty to say.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
A square?
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
Then my theory was correct.
Wow!
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
Fourteen hundred.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
Yeah, I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
LATER, MAN!!
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
What are you talking about?
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
So am I.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Caesar, I did my best.  The Colosseum isn't under my control...
Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
We all know what right is, Senator.
I hope you live to see what I believe...
That's what worries me...
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
The Senators admire you.
They fear me.
On my honor as your daddy...
What deal?
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
If you win, you know, you have to stay.  It's the losers who get to go home.  Besides, I'm not so sure it is over.  Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines.
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
I don't want you to die!
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Before they leave, get gold.
No.
I don't know.
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Of course not.
I do.
Oh.
-- really incredible --
Here he comes.
Well, I want you to leave.
Elaine -- I love you.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
The marble?
Carl who?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Thank you.
Plastics.
You heard me. Out of here.
Because I don't like you.
I am going to call the police now.
Well here's the purse.
Well I'll hand it to you.
I'd rather not.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Give me an hour.
It's in the main ballroom.
What for?
What do you drink?
When is he coming back?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
No.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
Waiter!
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want to?
Well -- I don't know.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Wait a minute.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Do you really want me to?
There's no risk?
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
But you don't hate him.
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
Don't tell Elaine.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Yes.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
What?
I was just kidding around.
Benjamin?
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Then give me your word you won't.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
How?
I just don't believe you would do that.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
What the hell have you done?
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
What?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
No wait. Wait.
Not if you don't want to.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
No.
Goodnight.
Have you thought about graduate school?
That has nothing to do with it --
What?
Yes, sir.
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
No, I don't.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
I could take care of her.
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Oh!
Really?
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Why do you hide in my room?
Strange man...
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
I --
When are you leaving Berlin?
For Vienna?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
I can't.
Yes -- I will be on the train.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Ready, Baron.
All of that at once, Baron?
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Good heavens. What for?
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
You're trembling.
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Moreover --
Moreover... 
I understand you perfectly.
Definitely off.
Hello!
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
You're sweet.
It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Preysing, you're joking with us.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Yes, I know them --
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Have I kept you waiting?
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
My son was in the hospital --
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
No.
You'll never shit right again.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Right in front of the room.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
Well...
Oh, sure. Fine.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
They twisted my arm.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
You don't have the stomach for it.
That's right.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I've really got to --
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
And Myra's stuff?
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
A future. The only future I've got.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
I can't. I just left home.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Are you sure?
Roy? It this all we have?
Nobody does that single-o.
Is that right?
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
I went out to Delmar.
Maybe I like it where I am.
Thank you.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
You up to it now?
Ate the gun. Oh.
I can be real stiff.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Doesn't look good.
No.  Wait for the police.
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
My office?
Betcha' didn't predict that.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
Will, sit down...
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
What?  Where is she?
Here, take my jacket.
Okay... thank you.
It's not going to happen.
Never.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
Shit, Linda!
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
We can light our own tree at home.
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
God ... this can't be true.
You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.
Or what's left of him.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Jamie's baby ...
No one.
Must have changed that law.
At least!
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
You're lucky, boy.  My house is gonna be filled with people.
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
Can I have the Cadillac?
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
Go home.
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
So long, Colonel.
How short the skirts are.
First Nagasaki--now this.
How about breakfast, wife?
She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
Huh.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I dunno.
In what way, pray tell?
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Is Penelope in?
Our pleasure.
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
To make an ass of yourself.
As a matter of fact--
Hello.
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Man and boy.
Everybody says he was so brave.
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
England?
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Scat!
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
It's Mom.
That's a rifle you have?
No.
Gee whiz, Dad--
What time do you get off work, my child?
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again.  What we need is a honeymoon.  Let's start right now.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
It couldn't!
Tell me about its sexual roots.
Yes.
And what is his most cherished possession?
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
What are you going to do?
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
A dozen?
He cried.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
Just one favor.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
What a handsome word.
Stop!
Ah!  The lady is armed.
I mean it!
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
I've literally got to run!
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
I was going to ask.
Would you say that again?
Hundreds.
Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
Comical?
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
King Arthur.
Cut me open.  Find out.
I've struck my blow.
With spittle?
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
I've enjoyed being man.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
How horrible.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Don't worry about it.
Kid--kid--
Don't!
I don't want to live any more.
No.
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I didn't know that.
For Heaven's sakes!
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
Something happens to my confidence.
Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
Far as I know.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
You're saying no.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
Tonight's the night.
It is?
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
That's the XKE.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
Meaning?
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
Is that a fact?
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
Do you want to take a session?
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
What girls you got here?
Man, how many girls do you need?
No.
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
You know her?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
And your wife? Where's she?
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
But what?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
In G.R.? Why?
What have you found out?
No.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
I don't know.
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Do you think she's safe?
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
But this is my apartment.
Yeah, sure.
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Pretty good.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Who?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
No.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
Sounds all right.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
You ever play Chicken?
To his own daughter?
Thanks.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
Oh, I don't have one.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
Eh, no.
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
She seemed yare to me.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
What is it?
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
No more revolts.
Well, I don't...
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
I like you, Maude.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Here.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
I thought eighty was a good round number.
"And this too shall pass away."
I have a sore throat.
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Mother.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
You don't care! "Miss Shroud of 1890 Weds the Boy of a Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...
Just give me a rough estimate.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Yes.
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
The moment of truth.
Another man's life in your sights.
ZAT!
Oh sure.
She took my head.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh, I do. I do.
Shit. Bull. Shit.
No. You look...
What's the matter with her?
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
What?
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
You were ALL human!
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Steve...
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
The Cenobites.
Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Is it bad?
Who?!
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Each of us gets a belt.
Father's back?  Still angry?
Goodbye.
No. I never was.
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
You're going alone?
Red, I --
Marco...
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Want to buy a bed?
Stay the fuck away from me.
You can keep them.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
I don't remember.
I came for the wedding.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Tell me who you are.
What?
You're still afraid.
No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
And the blood let you out?
I don't.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
Which is where?
Just to your left.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
Are you O.K.?
Oh, babe...
Sure.
O.K.
Plain soda?
I... suppose so, yes.
That's right.
No.
I won't be a moment.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
I love you, honey.
Maybe you should give it some time.
Gone?
I want to see.
Yes!
I have to get out.
It's late.
I see.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
It's not what I heard.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
What did I say?
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
But now I kind of like it.
We can take your car.
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Terrific.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
Oh well.  Nevermind.
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
Oh, hi.
Where's Rob?
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Yeah.
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there.  Instead of "Sin City."
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
No, that's okay.  Really.
Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
And do you like it that way?
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
Fine.  One.
Never?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
We'll talk some other time.
I told you I slept with him.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
It's me.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
Mmm hmm.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I don't want to go back.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
We took care of that.
I'm going to talk to you.
I don't know.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Fair enough.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
I understand completely.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
You haven't even seen it!
I'm sure it isn't.
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Good.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I knew this was going to happen.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
What's the name of your label?
Yeah.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
And you?
Why not?  I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
No.  I had to talk to you.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
I thought it might be a nice break from all of this.
Follow me.
At least.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
You killed those other two.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
There are differences.
Come here, Brenna.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
All of it finished.
You and I should talk first.
We've got nothing to say.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
What are you doing man?
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
How can you know this?
You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
That is not me.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Certainly not me.
Finish yours?
You seem to understand a great deal.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
It never changes, Major.
He's a MacLeod.
What name is he using?
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
Head still secure to the neck.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
Of sorts.
Tradition.
Go to hell.
Give me an address where I can forward Miss Cart- wright's head.
Hildy!
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
No. Roy. Roy V.
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
But --
I lost my wallet.
The check, Bruce!
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Hello, Bruce...
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
Say, I want to be sure, too!
Get out!
He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
Done what?
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
Listen, Walter --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Sweeney.
Bermuda.
The insurance business?
Thanks...
What for?
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
What tricks would I pull?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
I'd like to think.
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
What happened?
You been in a fight?
Will you come here?
Don't tell me you were worried!
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Then why are you doing it?
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
They can't do that to me!
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Yes, sir.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
So long, Hildy.
I guess so.
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Not this gun!
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Now what do you say?
Shoot to kill, I said.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
I was just going to!
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
I'm telling you!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Who is it?
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
Huh?
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
Ssh!
How much do you make a week?
Huh?
Who do you think!
Yes, yes!
Pinkus.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Come on, fellas.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
Why?
But Grandpa, you said...
Very well, Grandpa.
Looking for shrapnel.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
OK. You're in.
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
We thought it was poison.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
A bit too quick.
I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Naturally.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
I will if you will!
And the bride.
Oh, that.
It looks....foreign.
Fair enough.  The river.
There, there, my baby.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Am I? Maybe I am.
Yikes.
Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Huh... what cone?
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Oh yeah, the tree.
Whoopie fucking doo.
I was just wondering.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Oh yeah, I remember now.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
How much further?
I'll help ya.
Yeah, showtime for what?
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
There's not enough room.
I gotta open the gate.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
He should be back in a couple hours.
How's he get around out here?
He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
When you were outside with Bill.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I can't believe...
What? I didn't hear anything.
Recover any bodies?
You find something, Georgie?
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
Sorry.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Please, just a minute.
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
Right.
Right.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Excuse me for a second.
Oui.
You decide. Today is your day.
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Fine.
Unnhh.
I've moved on.
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
I don't know.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I want to be the way I was before.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
Okay. If you think it will help.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Always. Ow.
Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Oh, Rosie.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
You are a therapist, right?
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world.
Oh, and the sun block?
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Flares?
I love you so much.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
It's perfect!
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
All right.
I have to think! I have to think!
You are an animal.
I'm just preoccupied.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Should I come with?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Extra dessert?
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
Right.
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
Well, nobody has to sell.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
What did he say?
He drank as much whisky as you did.
I told you. I got drunk.
Thanks for the drink.
Seventy-five per cent.
I don't know when it was.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
I don't know.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
I'm a businessman, kid.
Fifty per cent?
Aaaahhhh!
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
In the gut, I mean.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Go to hell.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Glad to meet you.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Fine, thanks.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Do you always ask so many questions?
I'm not.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Okay. So what's your name today?
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
You got it all in your head?
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
I've got something in my bag.
Give it back to me.
Would he know?
First time for everything.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
Shut up.
Where do you come from?
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
What about... now?
I know it.  What do you want, Robert?
Yes.
Humans.
I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
Because the sky is so clear out here.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
About what?
Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
Of course.
A UFO lands in back of your house and puts something in your Dad and Mom's necks.  Then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
The State Police.
I know a way.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
You have to leave the White House.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
Did it work?
I'll bet.
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
Checkmate.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook...
You punched the President in the face?
You as well.
Then God help us.
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
Yes, Sir.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
It's... slowing down, Sir.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Dick-weed!
I know, you like to make a big entrance.
No. Exotic.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
I hear you.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
And before here?
What do you want us to do?
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
What?
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
The Name of God...
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
Uh-huh.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
So it did.
You do.
But what are you doing here?
Right.
Rats?
They want my diary.
Yeah?
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
What?
Dad!
I'm out, Dad!
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Relax.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
When?
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
Fly... yes. Land... no.
Ready.
Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
Where's my father?
No.
Who are you?
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
You think so?
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
There are no stories anymore.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
Step on it, Short Round!
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
You don't like him do you?
Why they glow like that?
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
Just try and control yourself.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
Quiet!
Yes.
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
Not quite.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
You got it!
This candid camera?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Shut up!
With a man in my head...
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Why don't you?
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
This is a Fiesta!
Why? AL  You know too much.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
I'll sue.
Where are we going?
Who did?
Good. Get to a phone.
The beach.
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
She doesn't seem to understand.
...Rene...
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
What are you looking at?
That place. By the window.
The drinks...Stay on them.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
You get time off to sleep.
I've got an idea.
Not sure at all.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Oh, I can't.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
**?!! 
And how do you service foreigners.
What?
When you do...
I didn't say anything.
...right here too.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
You're talking to me.
Who do you work for?
Hires you for what?
Why'd you run off?
Wanted to get to know you.
No, he didn't do that.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
What'd he steal?
Oh sure.
Ryuji and Gruner.
And Dieter.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
Hong Kong.
I know the territory.
You coming along?
It was my choice.
I love you too.
Aren't you a little optimistic?
It wasn't me. It was him.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Okay.
What's that outside, Daddy?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
P.J.'s.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
Are you sure?
How grave?
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Come again?
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Jim, it's Lowell.
Don't you have to be at the office?
I didn't want to leave it there...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Did you say Berman?
What are you and Mike going to do?
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
Lowell.
I disappeared on you?
If you want to do it.
I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
No.
They do this with impunity!
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
Did you have a good day?
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
No.
ABC Telemarketing Company.
I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you?
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
Right.
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
A delivery device for nicotine.
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
It acts as a drug on the body?
Yeah, I know you do...  You know, I came up through sales. One of the reasons I was a great salesman, was I never made a promise I couldn't keep.  I knew that if I ever broke my promise I'd suffer the consequence...
Well, I wouldn't say --
He --
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
Uh... poetry recitation.
We rest, Your Honor.
Why in God's name would I want...?
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
He's the wrong man.
Is she Asian?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
From a -- girlfriend.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
No, we're not!
I know.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
What kind of "stuff?"
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
Meaning my house.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
That's marriage.
Marylin?
Marylin!
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Murder!
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
I'm dying.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
So what?
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Yes?
When you have a moment.
She's here now.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
Did Marylin end up with money?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
I'm not sure.
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
I am very sorry.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
Do you have it?
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
Why don't you put me in chains?
I might.
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
South America.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
What've you got against King Westley?
You only met him once .
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Oh, no—no.
Yessir. She refuses them all.
Yes, sir.
They're practically all the same, sir. 
No.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
What am I going to do now?
I don't want it reported!
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Thanks, professor.
Well, you were!
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Not as long as I'm alive.
You're crazy.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
Well, take them off.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Really?
Carrots.
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
You're an expert, I suppose.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
We don't need forty cars.
If you do, I'll break your neck.
What about money?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Congratulations.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Oh, excuse me. 
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Okay, Joe. Listen—you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn—anytime I ran into a story that looked good—I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
Yeah.
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
What?
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Yeah.
Wife?
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Yeah—wouldn't it?
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with—
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
You love them, don't you?
No.
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, Jim. 
No, I did not.
...give me protection?
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I had the cause of death.
No.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
...you heard echoes.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
...in the course of that night, Mr. O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie stopped by the house... along with another young man...
Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency?
Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
A man just called.  He asked her everything!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
Well... yeah.
Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
What are you driving at, boss?
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
No.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you.  But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
You have other information?
Often?  He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
That's all you've had all this time?
That sounds fun.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
A bit.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Can I see your I.D.?
I don't think so.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
Why does it need to be dark?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Shit.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
'76?
What?... What'd you do?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
How old's Annette?
You talk them into it?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Sit down, leave the bag under the table?
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
What about you Max?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Uh-huh.
What do you do when he comes home?
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
It's not that simple.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Thanks, but you have a good time.
With the prior? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge. You want to think about it? You got two minutes before we're up.
Do you live together?
He say is a surprise.
You know what we want.
You ever see him sell guns?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
You didn't count it?
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
Buy ya a beer?
I'm waiting for the phone.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Beaumont Livingston?
Do you got something for me?
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
Yeah.
And what was your answer?
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
Baby, I didn't --
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
Yeah, I think a woman.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Plus the same deal as before.
Uh-huh.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
C'mon, don't lie.
Did you ever go I one?
I lived there for about nine months.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Does that bother you?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Uh-huh?
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Yeah, down the end.
You sure?
Okay, Lou-is.
What's your cost?
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
The moon -- I dunno
I'm in my underwear.
That was Beaumont.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
Did you get it?
Not now, pick me up.
You couldn't just hit her?
You shot her twice?
So you're sure she's dead.
Pretty sure.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
Now I need you to count your money.
Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
Looky here, I know you helped her and I know you know what I want. Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers. Long as at the end of that story, she hands over my money. She do that, we're still friends. Now, she don't wanna be my friend no more, tell her to think about ol' Louis. And if she tries to turn me in, I'll name her ass as my accessory. We'll go upstate together. Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that shit's a promise, understand what I'm sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll call you back.
Git your ass in here.
How the fuck did he find me?
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
That I gotta see.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
What isn't happening?
No, thanks.
What do you want?
Are you all right?
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Oh God!
Stop!!!!
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
There's nothing to expose.
What do you mean?
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
I'm too messed up to teach.
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
How do you know?
A bit.
She talk about the boys?
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
I can't relax.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
Yeah. You. Every time I see you. No more Errol Flynn, okay? Your back won't take it. You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
But I see them.
Carlson? Is he new here?
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
What's your name?
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
No. Don't move me.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
No. The little one.
Lemme see.
I enjoy crushing into you.
Why do you bring her up?
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Hey, I'm here.
It's gone to the top.
The numbers stop at 107.
Why didn't you call me?
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
Stay away from me, Jez.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
How do you know he's telling the truth?
Please.
Where are they?
Where have they gone?
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
I'm not upset.
I'm tired.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Mid-town mostly.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
I would have stayed there if I could.
They're awfully heavy.
What?!
I'm awake?
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
I work in a bakery.
Who is?
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
I'm looking for Dr. Carlson. Isn't this his office?
Is he all right?
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Get out of here!
He came for me, I had to run!
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Let's move out!
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
But I didn't see...
Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
I hope so.
What if we don't?
Were you close to your father?
Shut up, Thorgan!
GO, GO, GO!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
So what else is new?
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
I'm just saying.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Are there any other shuttles?
I love you.
We're missing two of the kids!
Defense droids. I'm on it.
Then open the doors!
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Get him out of there!
That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
What d'ya mean?
Swell.
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
What do we do?
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
Why don't we just tow it in?
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
Think the tide's with us?
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
I'm responsible for public safety around here...
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
This is Quint, Missus.
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
Anti-Shark cage.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure...
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
I don't like Katrina.
I totally heard you did.
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Huh?
Yeah. That was me.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
Okay.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Just like our moms and teachers!
What a trip, man.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
What are you talking about?
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
I'm a junior.
Good, I'll be sure to do that, Amanda. I'll make a note of it.
Shut up.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Why? What the big deal?
Consider it your musical education.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
Well, it was nice seeing you.
Vanessa, right?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Nothing...
Your name, please?
Congrats.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
You mean like couples?
Or...
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
It was magnificent, man!
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Right, seriously.
Eww, he's all beardy!
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
What do you make with that?
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
Hm.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
Adele for god sake please lis...
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Carryin' a gun.
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
Early, you are so sweet.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Best kind.
Brian.
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
Forget it.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
Why?
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
I don't know.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
No, never. Excuse me.
Without his car?
17.
Yes.
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Oh man, that's the best.
Let me smell it again.
How?
Right.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
He lives on 76th?
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
It's no big deal, right?
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
Yep.
They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
You got any money?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
Yep.
He looks like my uncle.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
Hold up man.
Casper, where is he?
Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
Yeah. Come on.
Is it cold?
Yeah. It'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace. That club shit gets boring.
How do you know?
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Bang up stuff.
Because, you know why. You know.
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
What?
Yeah, I guess so.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
No.
You are being ripped open.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Good luck.
I gotta find him.
Whah you say? Dissdee?
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
He still does.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
Yeah?
You've heard the stories right?
Oh god. That's horrible.
But then I won't need your money.
Shh.
You want a wip-it?
It's very monotonous.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
I'm positive.
You're a lying bastard!
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
She's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
I haven't got time for this.
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
Not really.
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
The police haven't told you?
I've figured out the message.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
What about prints?
No prints.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
But we heard him.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
He knows you're aware of that.
About what?
Whatever's on your mind.
Mate in five.
No.
Feel like practicing?
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
You.
She could be dead now.
Because I work with them.
I know it was bad.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
Doesn't that scare you?
Why?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
Does anyone?
I thought you said the line was busy?
What's wrong?
Can I come in?
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Frank told me.
I got lucky.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
All the passages are guarded.
Yes.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
Use your sword.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
What will happen?
Yes.
I cannot take comfort when she has none.
Fame.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
Naturally.
No.
No.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
That I am, my lady.
A fine match.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
The Widow of the Web?
She has the power to kill.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
She bore you many children?
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
130... 140...
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
What?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Mathilda, listen!
Huh, that's good!
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
Where?
I have new dreams now.
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
What?
You need a ride, Preacher?
That's enough.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
No I don't.  I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
You can change.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
About my love for her.
That's all right isn't it?
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
Umm, Coalville Utah.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
Saluting.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Sera you are crazy.
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
Where have you been staying?
That's right.
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
Go to hell.
I believe we are.
He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
Because they got wet.
Tell him, Paulette.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
I don't know.
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
I'm her sister.
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Yes, you are.
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
So?
No way --
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
How do you figure?
No, she can't move for an hour.
You're serious?
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
Maybe she found him like that.
Your what?
Harvard. Law school.
What, like it's that hard?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
Where's the Rock?
Cunnilingus?
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
What do you want with me?
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
Do it now!
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Blackheart?
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
There's the way, mates.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
The chill is worse this night.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Easily spoken...
Mean you to seek him out below?
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
I was with the Princess.
Never.
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
He did run?
I have no wife.
Only what's right...
They told me you were dead.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Exceeding fair.
Only that?
Do I not please you, Jack?
Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.
And as barren of love as stone.
Heading north still?
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Up ahead!
I'm sending you back to Hell!
You do know where it is?
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
Who are all these people?
Nope.
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
Where to?
Tell him I said "hi".
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
No thanks.
I'm okay.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
It would help me if I could kiss you.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
how much weight have you lost?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
Maybe...?
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
I almost saw Catalina.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I can promise you complete privacy.
I like how it feels not to feel.
To hide a black eye.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
At least your father tried, George.
I need you to do me a favor.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
Three.
Where have you been for a week?!
Where will you live?
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
I'm married.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
Let's go.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
This was my very first slow dance.
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
I need to know.
Does Alyssa know?
Nothing.
Don't even...I'm there.
Who?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
I never asked for more.
Either do you.
Yeah.
You could keep it and rent it out?
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Yes, it is.
And the baby?
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
I'm talking about a haircut.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
No, but...
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
She's alright, isn't she?
Want me to come back some other time?
You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
He looks like he can take care of himself.
That's right! Good old Monroe...
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
A loan officer?
Like this?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Here I am.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station.
What'd you say?
Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
It's too late for plans.
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Hey, Ray...
Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
1932? That's like, that's like...
Rayford!
Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
Understood.
Please, get out of my mind!
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
It's our time, brother.
Yeah, you do...
It would be so okay.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
What can I do about it?
Definitely.
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
Thanks.
You're not saying it's up to me?
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
The Dark Prince is here.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
You smell like coconuts.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Why would you be floating?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
We're ready.
I am.
Well... you can't have them all.
I'm in my party mood.
It has nothing to do with you.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
I don't..
Maybe you'll think of something...
I -- I can't.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
It's the only way.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
Things change!
You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
Beloved wife...
Yes...
Oh, my...
For as long as I can remember.
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Dead... they're dead... and buried.
Alive?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Good... You up for a drive?
Yeah.
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
What's that, Ed?
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
Sure.
I used to.
Pete... Don't...
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
Alice, I...
You killed him.
Wonderful, Pete. Really wonderful. Alotta people Pete... alotta people are gonna be very happy.
Sure.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Yeah? what did they want?
We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
What happened to me?
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
Pete, what happened to you?
Who was the man?
No, no. I want to go in.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
But my head...
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
What are you going to do?
I like to laugh, Fred.
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
But...
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
Okay.
What?
Okay.
Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
Yeah.
At your house. Don't you remember?
You want some company?
Whatiya mean?
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
YOU'RE SORRY!!
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
Not at all.
Is it?
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is—  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Yes.
Have I?
Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
Okay, Lovey.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Nothing. Why?
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
That's intelligent.
Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
The only one.
Yes, charming.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Do you mean to tell me you want to leave Shangri-La?
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Yes.
Do you think this will come in my time?
What's it mean?
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
Well - I mean—
Nothing about the porters yet?
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Yes.
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Where are we going? Huh?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
That was easy. I read your books.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
I wonder.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
Why?
Why?
Yes.  Barney!
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about your choice of targets.
Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
You got smeared.
I gotta be honest about something.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
Kay, I'm sorry...
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
Don't worry about it.
Well, first of all... I gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a Ferrari Testerrosa.  I mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
The Pentagon.
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Do his job.
in case I need it?
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
Out of focus?
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I wanna make a deal.
Scientific American?  Really?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
He'll turn around.
Someplace safe.
What --
RUN!
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Lara --
Hang on, Lamar --
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
I'm not getting halo'd.
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
Flaws.
You gonna tell on me?
That's right.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
Oh, Sean --
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
NO!
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Who made you do this?
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
I'm... not... a... killer.
You don't seem all that proud.
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
Why should I trust you?
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
You look great.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
I don't understand --
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
What?!
What kind of cop were you before this?
You mean after he lost your son.
You sure? I just made it.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
We have snifters
What, sir?
Is it the good room?
As far as...?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
He's great, right. Is he great?
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
It's daytime.
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
No.
Where were you?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Who's watching the baby?
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Go.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
With what?
Max offered to stake me.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
You driving her?
Yeah.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
So, when's the drop.
When's it going down?
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
Ricky's taken care of.
That's it.
Where's Ricky.
So, that's it. I'm out?
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
What is it?
Yes. Goodbye.
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Traveling light. I like that.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Understand me?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
I be off in a minute.  Say again...?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
Fuck him.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Seat belt.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
I don't know.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
Nothing.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
About what?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
Float me a hundred bucks.
Eighty.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
Think about it: You knocked out that Jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. Maybe lost his whole line of clientele? He knows you're fucking up Jess' dancing, and I got a feeling he knows I stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. He can't kill us in LA cause that leads to too many questions. So he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? He can make us disappear out here real nice...
You're not getting a gun.
Easy...
And you grew up in Manhattan?
What?
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Drinks are free, right?
What? Why am I bad?
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
Watch it...
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Word.
Yeah.
That money is your per diem.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
He has a cute what...?
I am.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Just now.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Okay, okay.
Don't con me.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Read it and keep on reading.
I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
Then the devil is white.
I sure met some.
No, Brother Minister.
If you want to tell me.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
Hush your mouth.
You're with me even when you're away.
What do you think?
I'm not made of glass.
Talk about what?
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Sure, man.
If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
I mean it's late, baby.
500.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
...That isn't a whore?
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
That's right.
Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man bleed like that.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
They talked about me like
I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
What do you want?
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[I have a friend there.]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
I said the plan was right here.
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
I'm a bargain.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
No.
Not at all?
Do you think he'll come back?
No.
Where?
Everywhere!
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
No.
Yeah. Two or three.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Could I stop you?
It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Our daughter.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[Is that good or bad?]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
What was she to Creasy then?
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I been looking all over for you!
It must be one o'clock.
We just talked.
Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
Oh.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
What happen?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Catherine, my sister...
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I'm having a very good time, too.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
I'll see you.
Sure, what?
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
Sure.
Right.
Sure, sure.
Tommy...
Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski – Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
You talked to Walt?
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
No.  Or why you should.
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
We're a good team.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
How did you get called that?
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
But I'm married.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Duke...
You really say the cutest things.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Yes, Reverend?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
Let's get his clothes off quick.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
There's only one worth noticing.
You guys got any black capsules?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
Sir?
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
That bad?  But I guess you're right. We might as well see him.  Got any caddie carts?
Yeah, maybe.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
With all of it?
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
John Doe Clubs? What for?
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Yeah, that's the one.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
A hundred dollars!
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
You bet I will, Ma.
Oh!
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Has he been here?
Yeah, a little.
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
Shut up!
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
Yeah? Well, you can have it!
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
John Doe Club?
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Sure.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appear—and in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
That's got nothing to do with it!
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Racket? What do you mean?
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
Sorry... Habit.
Only at the very end.
I know.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
Not the ones I'm at.
I don't really like to drink.
Okay, stop.
Still needs work.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
So what do you want to do?
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
I'll provide you with transportation.
I want to be put on this case.
True.
Why --
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
Just like you always wanted.
And down here --
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
-- I saw the program.
-- Christoph changed the maze.
It's not used for anything.
There was no need to kill her.
Insurance?
This.  No point to it.
Try me.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Uplink selected.
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
Zordon...  he's gone.
They're called squirbs.
Ah... sure.
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
... I just pray we're not too late.
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
What do you mean "basically"?
Activating Power Scope!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
Sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
You've got the public upset, Al.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Poor, yeah.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Scared.
Could we step outside?
You got men on Profaci's place?
Who hired the bastard?
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
For what?
Something came up.
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
How soon can we pull this off?
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Ya piss like a man.
It's only us and Sonny. Hey, Sonny. Come on out.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
Masseria's been after me too.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
How much?
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
Mother!
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
Mm hmm.
So, you come here all by yourself?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Forty-five all total.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Never.
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
But it *isn't*?
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
I apologize.
Any time.
Tunnel?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Is the wind tired out there?
Well, let's get going.
We're gonna get married.
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Susan? Nah!
Huh?
He's a house-afire!
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
No wonder--without your dinner.
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Yes, Jim.
*Your* political future! I bought it for you and made you a present. And I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. You got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot!  The man is--*Miller*.
Why, of course.
Is he fully aware that this bill has been months in both Houses--delayed and delayed--millions will be without food and shelter until its passage-- public works to relieve unemployment will be at a standstill--government agencies will be forced to suspend-- ?
Yes, I was--
Well, I'm sort of anxious to get back to the office--
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Did you say--bus?
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Convene?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Tonight.
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Calendar?
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
The Steering Committee.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
Have you always had to--work?
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Already? All these letters?
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Wait--
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
"So help me God."
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
Oh, now--that won't do--
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
He did it.
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
It's crucifying him--!
Anything *better* to offer?
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
Senator Paine.
Page boys!
Some people like it.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Always.
He sure is.
Your Honor!
Yes!
And you saw them happen?
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
What did they say?
Yes.
Now, what do you see?
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
You said I was a lady in distress.
He did?
I'd like to read it some time.
No, I don't mind.
Yes, of course.
I'm crucifying him.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Did it?
Is he really that big a sap?
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Right.
Hurry up!
Shhh!
Me, sir?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yes, sir.
Me sir?
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Mandrake Falls.  M-A-N—
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Yes. That is to say—
No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  Mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
I've got one for Cobb—
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Only common sense.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
A child? My uncle's?
Huh?
Oh. That.
Take the stand!
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I—
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
I don't know.
South Dakota north.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
Oh, I do too, sir.
What, sir?
No!  What do you want!!
Why are they ganging up against me?
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Good kids.
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
What kind of doubts?
What's that?
Good, then go.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
Nope.
I've had my moments.
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
Yes, your honor.
What?
Oh?
What?
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Where am I supposed to eat?
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
I'm trying.
Got to.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
Can I ask you something?  Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  So what changed?
Is she against you getting help?
I've offended you!
Be specific.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Uh-huh.
Is that like a party trick?
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
You like it?
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
Yeah?
Transference!
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
It's a big part of the show.
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
Uh-huh.
Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
That's all right. What's on your mind?
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
But look at me now...
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
All new people start with that...
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
What'd I do?
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
You're not going to kill us?
Sounds familiar.
Oh yes, always.
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
Two hundred pounds.
What are you doing here?
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
No?
You swear?
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Want to know?
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
We're about to be shown the way.
Preparation for what?
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
And what is that?
No, we are not.
It's everybody's problem!
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
And what's that?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Do I?
So who killed him?
The Disco Boys.
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
And some sandwiches --
I'm the Bowler.
I can't.
I dunno.
Yes!
And the nuts always call themselves great.
They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
Terrific.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Then why are you here?
Every night.
Have you always lived here?
Me, too.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
And what if you get killed?
What?
My heart died a long time ago.
LOOK!
So when are we gonna have an on night?
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
Good point.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Are you coming or not?
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
I can't.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Or flowers.
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Oh hi, Mom.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Definitely.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
I'm not insulted.
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
And where is the army?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
But who made this treaty?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
I don't know, sire.
And where is Joseph?
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Have you been back recently?
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
The first reports came in at about ten.
What is that?
And he sent you to me?
No, sir.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Yes, it must be.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Junot?
Not even the slightest hint of something?
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
When is she supposed to return?
Ah, that is good.
May I offer you a drink?
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Yes.
One had better legs.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
I don't understand you.
Will you be joining us, soon?
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
My God, what do you think?
Yes.
Can you give me a drink, please?
I believe so.  I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
No.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Show him in.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
Yeah.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Suga!
What happen?
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Why?
Okay, plan B.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
That ain't gonna work.
I don't know yet.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Come on.
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
Go for it.
Ya'll live around here?
What?!
I don't know.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
I don't know, Debo.
Keep pushing.
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.
Oooh, ba-by!
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
What?
You just come in on Amtrack?
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
And your husband works for somebody else.
Then I have time for a drink.
That's right. That gives you...
Forget about it.
You know what I'm gonna do.
All right.
Cover your mouth.
Who?
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
What!?
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
I don't have to pay you nothin'.
I don't think so.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
That's good.  That's good, sweetie pie.
I've got something for you.
Shut up.
Keep your eyes peeled.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
Listen to me John.
Not even her?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
They hid in a broom closet!
She went.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Bluebeard!
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
Amen.
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
There! What's so hard about that!
Blue men.
The Blue Men?
Yes, I reckon that's it.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Hush.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I'll make coffee.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
What secret shall I tell?
All right.
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
The first night?
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
Where's she at?
It's just made her think... her dreams are real...
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
No.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
You heard me. I grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
What?
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
School.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Okay.
Put that damned thing down!
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
The door was locked from your side.
No.
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Aren't you late?
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
You should. I'll show you.
I see.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
You want this?
That's another thing... it's spring.
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
That's right... and we might as well face it.
Monsieur.
With two f's, if you please.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Have you?
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
No, sir.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Count d'Algout...
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
Razinin.
Two thousand francs.
That's even better.
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
No, thank you.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Au revoir.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Private.
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Oh no. No visa.
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Me?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
He takes good care of that.
Thank you. Thank you.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
Oh, let it ring.
I don't like your following me.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
What?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
Did you make any change in this room?
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
Thursday.
Comrades! Good people of France!
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
...but big.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Am I interrupting?
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
You leave me no choice.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
Can you recommend a restaurant?
Where is that?
How do you do, my friend.
Never.  I never said that about Jews!
He told me to take you to his conference room.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
Son of a bitch.
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
Is it?
How so?
Yeah?
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
Sir, there's dead American kids here. Let's say we don't apologize for Kent State, but maybe we could have a national prayer day ...
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Cox!  Fire him.
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
Lincoln used it.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
I didn't want him to get the credit. He said I'd stabbed him in the back. Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from Whittier.
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
Money.  Follow the money.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
When I met with him, he said ...
He'll give us the documents.  But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go without a whimper.
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Yes.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
I never met the man.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
I always get my man.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
There's no other choice.
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
Free, if you're the president.
Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
Ernie Davis.
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
Then what's the point?  What's the point of being president?  You're powerless.
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
Amen to that.
I want a divorce.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
Do you really want this, Dick?
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Anything.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
They're all your enemies?
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
You're a long way from Whittier.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
You're drunk!
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
To what?
Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
How fresh is this coffee?
You don't know what he thinks.
Yes I do.
You're discouraged.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Well what would you call him.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Some pretty bad people.
That's very linear Sheriff.
You figure him for a dope runner?
No. Probably I don't.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
Yessir.
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. It may come to three times before it's over...
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
I put it in, Mama.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
I need to know that.
Yeah.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
I know something better.
And where is that.
It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
I can't say.
Is Llewelyn there?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Not a bleep.
You from around here?
Do you know where I'm going?
Didn't mean nothin'.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
I could come back then.
You live in that house behind the store?
You married into it.
No.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
When did you last see him.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
Then you'll like me.
What did you do?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
Yes sir.
What outfit.
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Great. Good. Content...
They're fine... you miss it?
Do you know why I'm here?
...to see you.
This is really awkward...
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
I gotta go.
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
Yes, she is.
Of course.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
I know. It's up to us.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Uh-huh.
I begged him to let me put that on!
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
How did you know?
I'll go to the Hospital.
Like Rome?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
...did I win some contest?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
God, that's awful!
I was talking about what you could wear!
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
You still in love?
He is real.
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
If we're for real?
No...
I... I don't know...
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
That was to get him to talk!  Get rid of that thing, will you?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
...among others.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
You need to remember who you're talking to...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
What do you mean?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
It is, if you like idiots...
What the hell's going on?
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
Better.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
She's a lesbian.
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
Where's Tommy?
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
That ain't it!
Latch right on to that tit.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Not out the other side his face, though.
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
You -
Well, we need that ring.
Uh-huh.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
It was in his bureau.
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
I am. Hur you?
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Yes, Sir.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Okay, okay. You win.
Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
I joined the Navy.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
You got it, Sweet Pea.  Nice boonies, Seeger.
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
A long time ago.
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
I want to fly jets, sir!
I didn't call you anything before that.
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Is your brother a flyer?
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
We don't have to talk at all.
Then, I'll see you around.
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
One more minute.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
No way... Would you?
No! That's not true!
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Me, too.
Forget it. Just get out of here.
God.
What would you do differently?
That's brilliant.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
Peace out.
There is not one thing funny here.
Yes.
You got an idea?
Get the fuck away from me.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Different tables.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Jesus, what was I thinking?
I mean it!
You don't look so good.
Huh?
What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
What?
What do they want?
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Don't though. 
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
What if I do?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Fuck that, we've got company...
What are doing with yours?.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
N... N...... Not... Oh.
Hmmm. As you know the Bureau -- and Mr. Hoover -- is particularly "sensitive" to anything that might agitate or solidify the coloreds on the left.
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
What, I don't know how you mean?
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
Fuck maybe... be there.
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Where is he?.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
No.
That would be nice, too.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Colonel will do.
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Are you going to meet with him?
I understand, sir.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
How old are you?
I didn't see any.
Father?
As you did at Fort Wilderness?
Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
That's a damn long time...
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
It is ended.
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort.
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
And what is the second thing?
Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Yaay!
To remember.
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Do you believe that?
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
Seems like you told me about a promise you made--
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Yes, but--
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Ayuh.
Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
Nope. He's your cat now.
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
Leave me alone!
You don't understand--
Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
It's beautiful!
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Louis, are you sure?
I will.
Elizabeth goes free!
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
He didn't waste it.
Men!  Are you up for it?
Would that I could.
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
It would appear, so do you.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
First -- have you found me a crew?
And you've got that, have you?
Ah -- he's learned, then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night, there was a mutiny.
That we are.
We'll see about that.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Pirate.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
How?  The key's run off.
It's still against the law.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Barbossa.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
Speak.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
No.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
It's ready now, I know it is.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
Nebbleman.
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Aaabout...?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
Well, you got another problem.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Who isn't?
Really?  What have you been doing?
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Right.  You predicted it.
Got it.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
No cheese.
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Gallagher?
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
You're acting like a child.
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Oh boy, I'd love it.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
Yeah?
I'll bite. What's the catch?
Yeah?
Drunk, sir?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
I dyed one and washed the other.
My mistake - she's glaring.
What could I be?
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
It'll be ready in a minute.
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
I don't eat waffles.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Okay - you remember Joe—
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Double strength!
Are the cars ready?
This man's impossible! I can't talk to him. Grayson, let's go where we can talk - hic!  See what you've done to me!?
Have you seen this? 
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Heavens! The man's insane!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
A bird in a gilded cage?
Very good, sir.
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
It doesn't matter.
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
... It's a pretty short trip.
Thanks.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Hunh?  Oh, right ...
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
I'm fine--but thank you.
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
Rain.
Okay--that's enough!
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
Green.
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
I don't know.
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
What do you mean?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
So what's the point?
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Yes.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
We'll just put up the top.
Marmalade.
My name's David.
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Oh--well ...
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
Look ...
Because you're coming home.
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
... What's that?
No, that's not it.
Well here I am.
So you can't talk to me?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Ok, bye-bye.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
No.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
I don't know.
Are you gonna do it?
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
Yes.
Hi. This is Jack.
No.
No.
Are your pants off?
Really?
Where is she?
...yeah....well you have me now.
You sound very cute, very nice.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Can I ask you a question?
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I don't have a girlfriend --
Yeah, not really.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
It's terrible, no.
Yeah.
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
What happened?
Ok.
Did something happen; are you alright?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Yeah?
I just wanted to make sure.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Yeah.
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
Let's go to the hospital.
Ok.
No.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
What's that for?
You just told me to fuck off. That wasn't good. You're dead.
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
Hi Walter.
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
It's alright.
Can you hang on a second?
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
That's funny.
Hi.
I need to talk to you for a second.
Wait a minute --
How much money do you have in your pockets?
What is this, man?
Seven o'clock.
I know.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
It's fine.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
Are you sure?
I'm sorry. You're right.
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
"Turn you out?"
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
Don't be so sure.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
A man after my own heart...
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
An innocent child is dead.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
Was it impotence?
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
You're a sentimental man.
Oh indeed?
Quite.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Is it terribly erotic?
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
....shame on you, truly...
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Last week would this be?
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
Over at RKO?
Uh-hub.
Yeah
One . . . buys things.
This picture--
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
I don't want you to--
Yes?
Sir? 
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
I don't wanna write about no spic.
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Jesus
Oh Christ
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
We're doing Hearst.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Hedy Lamarr?
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
George...
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
Thank you-
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
Then find another theater
For Christ's sake, shut up--
"Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
I know what you want but it can't be done!
Yes!
I'm Christ
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Believe what you want.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
Go ahead.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
What do you mean?
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
What do you mean, "you"?
I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
Should I hit it?
But, Jake, I was just...
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
You asleep?
That he's got a pretty face.
I never noticed his face.
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
You did?
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
Are you drunk?
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Jefferies?
Namely?
That's what they call a family problem.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
I was jaywalking.
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
Mrs. Thorwald.
All the things I hate.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Tell her to bring it back!
Well, I only quote from the best.
That's normal.
People have different emotional levels that --
I was.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
Police?
You called the police?
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
Smart girl.
You haven't even heard from him?
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
What are you getting at?
125 West Ninth Street.
All right -- but what's he doing now?
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Is he cleaning house?
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
Stay there.
Buzz Gundersen.
Smashed the front door.
You see any cops?
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Yeah!
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
That's not what I mean.  I've never done anything right.  I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it.  I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
Sure.  Sure.
Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
He's just loaded, honey.
Well maybe she better start.
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
What's a chickie-run?
Yeah?
There's only one key.
Not lately.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Why?
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
And your folks didn't understand?
They never do.
What?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Okay--
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Bully for you.
Won't mother be proud.
Dig the square wardrobe!
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
There's just one thing.  What about--
Should we explore?
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
I never felt so clean before.
It is for me too.
Yes.  My best friend.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Okay.
What?
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
NO!
No, baby. He wants me.
We sell children's toys --
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Radio said negative five.
No, no --
Then he shoulda signed his name.
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Not without you.
They're truck drivers.
Get to the bridge!  HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
We'll need one.
They all are. Football's on.
Yeah. That's love.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
No, you can't --
The hell I can't.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
What'd they call her in college?
What's her greatest fear?
Hey.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
Christmas... Eve...
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
Six men means six guns.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
How'd you know my name was Rudy.
How'd you know my name.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
Show's over.
I don't steal any --
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
It's a roach, guy --
Oh, man --
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Oh.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
Aw, Rudy.
Ash... Ashley...
YOU TELL HER!
NICK!!!
She set them up. All of them.
There is no other table --
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
He is a motherfucker. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job.
A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
Pam Grier.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
This better not be some Freddy joke.
Yeah.
What about?
The Brewers.
But what is this?
What for?
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Who gives a damn?
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
What're you talkin' about?
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
It's a surprise.
Joe.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
Why not?
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
I got the diamonds.
That was the plan, we meet here.
For all I know, you're the rat.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
I don't know anybody.
Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
If I have to tell you again to back off, me an you are gonna go round and round.
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
So you wanna git bit, huh?
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
He's learning his letters.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
The who?
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
Maybe it's better that way.
What?
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
In a fight?
Yes.
All right. I'll tell you.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Can I have my gun back?
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
I said I didn't care.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
And you're all alone.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
Where is he?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
I sure would.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Sure.
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Great!!!
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Listen to me I --
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
So, whatever happened to her?
It's okay.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Right behind you.
Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they're hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what I mean.  Ooh, I like her.
In about fifteen minutes.
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
Just a little experiment.
Just a little Rogaine.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
Don't worry, I got your back.
What happened?
She wouldn't...
No more violence... No more violence...
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
She sure can pick 'em!
Looks good, Mom!
Your mom killed my brother!
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
You bring me such peace...
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
No, I don't.
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Yes, but I lent it...
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
You can't tell.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
No.
You could go and open the door.
Yes.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
But you do believe me?
Drink your milk.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
But I'm not joking.
Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I don't know.
And you knew he'd be here.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it —— to know me better.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
It's here, too.
What a peculiar question.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
After that wonderful first book —- after all the adulation and the good reviews?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
I'd forgotten.
You'll have good enough sense to tell us where she is -— when you know she's a murderess. She killed a man.
I think it's time.
I'd like that.
A gay lot -— Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
Thank you, my dear.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
She's very beautiful.
Why
What?
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Graham Dalton.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Well...
No, not really.
Who's Elizabeth?
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
You had sex with you therapist?
What kind of personal project?
Donna?
What about sex?
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Yes.
Does he go down on you?
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
Yes.
You said you weren't always impotent.
And you feel the same way with John?
Interesting analogy.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
I can't tell you like this.
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
Why don't I believe you?
He does.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Did you do anything?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
I guess.
Yes.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
He doesn't have a phone.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
No!
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Okay.
How did you find me?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
I just want to ask you questions.
And you ask questions, right?
No.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
Then what happened?
Do you think I'm pretty?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
I want to see you.
I don't think my sister would agree.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
It hurts that you would say that to me.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
I like having the car, the car is important.
Brian Kirkland, please.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
Was he nice to you?
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
Down to the incinerator.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
We live in 703.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan.  Must have gone home to mother.
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
OK. I'll think about it.
I don't get it.
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
Of course.
I've caught it once or twice.
They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Yes, Betty.
I don't want to get up there.
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
I NEED SOME
No...couldn't I do this later?
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
We're not confused.
Good. That's good.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
How's the trip?
Glass or bottle?
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Nice.
Anything I'd know?
No, we're paying for the wine.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Yeah, Conundrum.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
And Lexapro, yes.
And get your bone smooched.
I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
If that's what feels right.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
So what's the plan today?
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
We were supposed to play golf.
With this chick.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Oh yeah. Sure.
Thanks, Jack.
Huh.
Let's leave it alone.
I know what you need.
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Yeah.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
What?
The plan is... you go.
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
You said it looked like a car accident.
Yeah.
Maya, how are you?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
The Windmill.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
I know. I love that.
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah, same here.
Um... yeah but it's more...
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Yeah.
Good. So did I.
Okay. See you around.
Okay.
So what's happening with your book?
I'm pregnant.
Yeah.
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
Only for pee or poop.
It tastes funny.
Clear for what?
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
Got it!
Graham.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
They tell you everything in this book.
Don't yell at her!
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
No.
Why not?
No money, eh?
What do you mean, the horses?
You're in here for winging a guy?
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
Chicago. Working in the slaughter- houses.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
I just came out to say goodbye.
And you're not Baxter, either?
Not for five years.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
Right!
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
You've got a legitimate job.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
This is a lot of money.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Paden.
Give me some of the good stuff.
I don't want you to get hurt.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
Spare me.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If they're good, they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.  I'm sorry, Viktor.
"Forever".
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Better late than never.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Not if I don't let her.
How much wine have you had?
Hello, is this Elaine?
Of course.
... so much like her?
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
You're with me to be close to her?
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
Hello, Hal.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
There's... a wall between you --
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
You want me to call Security?
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
-- Flesh is weak.
"Straw God" changed my life.
You saw that?
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
Why?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
If anyone asks about Simone --
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
This is the story.
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
Why?
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
Taller, Viktor.
Taller?  What?
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Good.
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
I knew there was a sound explanation.
Dr. Crowe.
You're a doctor. What kind?
Yeah. Sorry.
What about Mrs. Marschal?
Yes.
Your eyes told me.
I don't know, Cole.
You weren't a paper champion.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
No.
Tell you my secrets.
...I don't know.
Stop looking at me.
Who!
S-ssssstop it!
Chuck E. who?
You're standing in horseshit.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Witch.
Not according to these.
I could. You sucked.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Hi Suze.
I'll be fine here.
Sure. What do you want to know.
What's wrong?
So?
Listen to me --
No. Not without you --
Never.
Like what?
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
Just checking out the lights.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, Grant.
No. What…?
Okay.
You took Bill.
And this is mine.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
Sorry.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
That's not true -- Where are you--?
When one sees you they all see you.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
You to forget this dumbass Roadeo and take on a real challenge.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Eyes on the road.
You have a great profile.
Hey...
Enjoy your Kenworth.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
How do you know?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
And?
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I hate to say it...
We're gone.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Now what?
It's gonna be close. Real close.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- so you shut them off?
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
No.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
Yeah.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Two of 'em?
I sent Hugo, he should be there!
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
Alright, bag it, I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole, this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now, he should have his cell on, I need an update.  Get the Russian up here, have him clean this place, floor to ceiling and get us packed.  ...And send out for some new skeeze, the sun's up, these ones are starting to stink...
The Deputy Director, this prick Locke, he smashed the whole thing, we're done, they won't tell me why...
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
True?
That takes some of the sting out.
A Fed? Like FBI?
What!?
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
...What are they doin' right now...?
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
A puppet.
And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human!
Where's his body?
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Probably.
Why?
I want you inside me right now.
Stop it.
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
As I said, then it's God, right?
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
You... she said I didn't love her.
I love you, too.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
He is.  But he was here...
I'm disgusting.
Then you'll die.
You never said you wanted one.
I never said I didn't.
I can't stay here.
You're lying.
Yes, you are --
But then I would be dead now.
I wish you wouldn't.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Looks a little constipated to me.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
There's a phone in the car.
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
I got money.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
No kidding.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
And "is"...?
No dog.
Very nice.
You asked.
Claire, will you calm down?
Claire...!
Oh that thing in Queens.
So.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Sure we are, let's go!
I'm all right.
Too kinky.
What?
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
I might stop you.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
I'm not saying it's your fault.
No.
I'm all right.
When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment.
It should've been me...
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
I asked for the man in charge...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Mom and I got plans.
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
I'm always here, Pete.
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
I got you a present.
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
No!  Now get outta my face, kid.
Frmpph-yrr.
Hmf-hrr?
What's this? A cockaroach?
How about tomorrow?
You're making my life difficult.
Well...
It's too early to be clever.
What?
You should write that one down.
Does it have a human name?
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Hi, Adele.
I've got no problems.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
Well, no.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Strong...
Some of him… char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Any sign of our friend?
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Yes.  Do you have a date?
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
Really, Professor, I--
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Bonkers.
I'm not so happy myself.
They never caught on.
We did not.
Get going on the trap door.
We'll get some more.
You stink, Sefton!
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Take it.
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Don't wear it out!
Which one of you is what?
Not you.
What are the chances busting out of here?
I'll live.
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
Abfuehren!
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
It is.
Say, Schulz --
You should live so long.
Raus! Raus! All of you!
Betty Grable!
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
Animal! Got a little something for you!
You're crying, Animal.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Are we boring you?
Says me.
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
Check.
At ease! He also says, quote: All you sack rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody. Unquote. At ease! Monday afternoon a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool. See Oscar Rudolph of Barrack 7 if you want to enter a yacht. Next: Jack Cushingham and Larry Blake will play Frank deNotta and Mike Cohen for the pinochle championship of the camp.
Oh.
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Ich weiss alles.
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
I do not want those cigarettes.
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
That is my wife.
It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
What do you mean?
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
Commander.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
Agreed.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
All hands, brace for impact!
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
I can't remember very much - what it looked like or how long I was there. But I do remember how it felt.
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa.
That's right.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
How is that possible?
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Locate.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
My readings indicate great instability.
Spock's burial robe.
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
What's wrong?
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Close... There --
No, sir, no response.
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Welcome home, Jim.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
I -- saw no future --
He asked you not to grieve...
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
What you ask is difficult.
How is that...?
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
I can spare me...
It's like the Garden of Eden...
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
Never mind! Hurry!
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I'm Doctor Marcus!
He's on a build up to detonation!
I didn't expect anything.
It was just words.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
I'm going down to the station.
Try the emergency channels...
Sensors, Captain?
Aye...
I am understandably curious.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
Home.
To be sure, Captain.
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
It's all we've got.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Be careful, Jim...
Steady as you go...
He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
Or the one.
I did not think so.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
Take the test again.
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
The question is irrelevant.
I do this because I was there,
Just a couple of kooks...
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
Not me, Bones... They did it.
... My shoes...
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
That is what I said, Doctor.
Then how.?
Well nobody's perfect...
I was not informed about observers.
Name?
No, <u>my</u> name.
You play games with me and you're through
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
I'm wery sorry, but --
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
I suppose they told you that...?
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
Iowa.
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Then --
Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
Hm?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What do you mean now?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
... Damn!
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
Permission granted.
Thank you, Admiral.
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
Whales?
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
Surely you can be more specific...
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Weapons systems?
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
Mercy Hospital.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
You will be in good hands here.
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Of course.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
That's the ticket, laddie.
Right on. You fly?
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
Really.
Androids... don't have...fun.
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
It is not over.
It is over.
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
Recommendations?
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
I don't believe it happened that way.
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
On screen.
Yes, we do.  You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
Deck ten.
You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Is there any other way to disable the injector?
Why was Data assigned?
You should feel right at home with them.
But it's comfortable.
... I believe you...
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Augh?
Absolutely.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
No.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Where?
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
<U>Engage.</U>
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Great name. French?
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
Friends from Cornell...
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Population... thirty-five billion...  All Borg.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Go to manual.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Life signs?
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
Right.
Understood!
We've lost Bridge control!
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
What are you suggesting?
Target...
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
Data's positronic net contains classified information on the Enterprise. Command codes, security protocols...
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
That cunning little Vulcan...
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
We were until your torpedoes!
Stand...?
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.  We're outside the shield. Now it's your turn, Kirk.
He just tried to save him!
I checked the data banks, yes.
That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Do we report this, sir?
This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
Where do we come in?
Possibly.
Captain, if --
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
Surely not.
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
Faith...?
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
I don't want to.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
Then it's time we were heading home. Three years is...
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
I know precisely where he'll be.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
Why?
Why?
Can you describe it, Deanna?
Dying?
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
Now, you make a toast.
Aye, sir... This way.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
You do not look like me.
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
Why?
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Do you have a name, sir?
Emergency force fields are holding.
Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
The resemblance is... striking.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Do you have life support?
Understood.
Theories?
As I remember, Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
That will never happen.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
Aye, sir.
She's a predator.
We can only hope so.
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
New worlds.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
You know that's not possible.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
I am.
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
He's a very unusual android.
Let's go.
Find her again.
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
Credit card.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Stay right there...
So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
I just retired.
This is George Fox...
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Good.
Flashlight.
Gas good?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Are you from up there? Space?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Okay.
No.
I...
No.
No.
When we get here.
Then don't be smart.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
The captain...
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Hurry up.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
I don't want you to be hurt.
You're damn right I am.
Do they talk?!
But...
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
I understand.  Thank you.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
What will you say about us?
Many, many days and nights...
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Wait'll you see it.
I know, but...
To the same woman?
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Yeah, right.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
But this is a bad one.
Top ten.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Is he dead?
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
What?
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Who was just here?
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
She never gave me a tape.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
In LA?  Are you crazy?
Get it.
Jesus, Lenny.
Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
She still loves me.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
No idea.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Never really thought about it.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Well, look at the plus side.
It was a tough call.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
I still got one ace to play.  Tran's got what I want... and I've got what he wants...
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
I'm on my way.
You heard?
Winona.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
From the grave?
Then why do I still have a badge?
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
I was looking for a pattern.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
How long have you been downtown?
You got a point there.
Sex.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
Sue Ann Hanson.
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
You did.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Start killing people for real?
Suspect Zero.
I've got to take a piss.
How are we going to find him?
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
No weapon.
Yes.
He's moved on to TV.
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
Please. You can't hide from me, sonny. I invented the questionnaire. I can tell those who talk from those who do it in the time it takes you to fart.
You? You went by the book?
Yeah.
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
[You tell me.]
[What does the file say?]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Thomas Mackelway.
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
Jesus, just what I need, another blue flamer.  Johnny, get this boy some sun screen.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas?
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Shit.
I know, I know.
What kind of car do you drive?
I thought I was going to die.
Like what?
Anything.
...not until you book it...
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
What an asshole.
Did you get it?
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
It's a rebound.
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
I would love to see you again sometime.
I can call back...
That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
You don't call.
Right.
There's the rub.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
Why?
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Him?
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
I'll be your winger.
No. Just O.J.
Oh boy.
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
He's trying to be an actor.
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
I don't know...
When?
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Vegas!
Vegas.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
You think they're watching?
What?!?
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Let's just leave.
Let's go.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
You think so?
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
No! Not the camera guy!
I'm telling you!
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
What?!?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
I hear she's getting real fat.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
What a surprise.
No, baby!
Oh. He's got it under control...
Now?
True.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
What'd you want me to do? Back down? He called me a bitch. We kept our rep.
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...it's on.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
Sure.
Are you worried about security for your million?
I'm not rich anymore, Godfather, and...my career, I'm almost washed up...
When did he call?
This morning.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
For killing a man.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I know.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Take me to America!  You need a good lupara in America?  You take me, I'll be the best man you got.  "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..."
Mike!
Okay.  One minute.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
You know I love spaghetti.
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Just you.
I'm thinking about it.
Can you say it?
Tell me you love me.
Please say it.
OK. 
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Let HER ask.
Don't ask me.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I won't panic.
Maybe.
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
Be patient.
You think I scam?
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Oh, it was.
What? What's this?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I love jazz.
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
What?
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Who is it?
What about Christmas?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Yes it is.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Bird. That's jazz.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Where's Dickie?
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
He's having an early night.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi.  And now look at you.
Which is?
Is Freddie in Rome?
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
You know what -- I am.
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
It's okay.
What do you want to change about this moment?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Postmortem?
What about Ripley?
Does he stay with you here?
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
Absolutely.
That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
Huh?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Yes?
My name is Travis.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
Really?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
What hours do you work?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
I'm getting a taxi.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Oh, Tom, please.
Ouch!
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
No, why?
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
One-Ball McCall?
What's your real name?
You want to make it like this? 
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Why not?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
What do you mean?
No.
Physical? Criminal?
Twenty-six.
Some. Here and there.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
You moonlightin?
Anything you say, officer.
No.  Hillbilly, you'd better get your wise ass outa here and quick, or you're gonna be in trouble.
Things got ya down?
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
Neither do I, I guess.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
You suppose?
Yes.  You'll be outside.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
Now they only have three rockets left.
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
You knew?  All this time?
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
Thanks, I like it.  I think.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
I do?
Why me?
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
The Bijou?
Thanks.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Yes?
... what?
Thanks.
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
No, I...
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
Oh...
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
Yes?
And what had you done?
She already has a daughter.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
Then go.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
If your father were here...
Could I have a puff?
If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
Lois!
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
See them two big trees across there?
The two kids?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
D'you want me to order one for you?
What name?
I need her exact name, you see.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
Impossible.
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
No. Here's fine. 
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
How long have you known her?
I told you. We met yesterday.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
I know, Mother.
When?
Get a rope!
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
Did you close the door?
Not by the thousands.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
These birds were...
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
I understand completely, sir.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
Aren't these lovebirds?
Are they moulting now?
But how... how do you know my name?
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
I think you're a louse.
How do you know Annie?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
Look, Mr. Brenner...
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
Why?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
What'll it say?
Yes.
No, I have my things in the car.
Really? Tell me about it.
Certainly, of birds.
So they united.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
I'm frightened, Mitch.
How long have they been gathering there?
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Inland.
Mitch...
How soon?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable.  Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
We need them.
Mr. Gray?
Good.
I want you to help my little girl.
Yes.
I'm cold as ice.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
Aye.
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
MacFarlane
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
We can't be sure of that.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
Why, yes.
Maybe there's another reason. Maybe you haven't friends enough. Could that be it, Georgina?
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
Why don't you do it then?
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
No.
Hear him?  Did you ever see the lads play knife?
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
How long ago?
Aye --
I don't know you, man.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
What did they give you?
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
How can you die if you're already dead?
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
Shut up.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
I want you... to bend over.
Just hold on to me.
Looks like you have them both on.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Of course, dear.
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Yes, I have!
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir.
Not very good news, I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
I can judge only by what I see.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
What about him?
I enjoyed every minute of it.
May I walk out with you?
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
I'm sorry.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
Yeah.
We don't ride with vampires.
You gotta drive!
Zero.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
No.  Stick around.
Well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  And today, his dog attacked my mom.  Listen to this.  From <u>Vampires</u> <u>Everywhere</u>...  'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a <u>Guardian</u> -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, <u>fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell</u> <u>-- are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>.'
Chill out Edgar.
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
For what.
He's not breathing, Mom.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
No.  I'm up.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Smells like something died.
Can we get a T.V.?
Not funny, Sam!
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Now you and David...
Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
So do I!
Will you give Mom a break?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
Don't bother.
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Yeah.
What was he doing in the rec room?
So what's our problem?
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Have you come across Fuchs?
Don't walk behind me.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Look, I'm just guessing...
We got morphine, don't we.
What?
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
Then I'll have to kill you.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Enough, MacReady!
Bennings?
A couple of hours.
Well, get to it.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
No.
Don't let up, Childs!
Little over two hours.
So what do you make of it?
On the towers?
Exactly like you.  Well, maybe not as healthy.
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
What happened?
No...
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
But there's nothing here.
How did you know?!
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
You know of them?
Yes... Thank you.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
I just love mechanical things.
Dance with me...
Trust me...
Sorry... I was distracted.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
You're getting warmer.
Trust me...
All right...
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
She's gotten into your equations.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
Hiding?
I care more about my life.  And yours.
His home.
I don't understand.
Thank you.
Your husband is dead?
You're not from beyond the valley.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
Why not?
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
Good night.
We all have that dream.
I don't understand.
Yes.
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Do you have it?!
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
Why?
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
What's it like where you come from?
Should we be...
In where?
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I don't understand...
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
You may have known my father, William Starks.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
To the hospital.
Ok, I guess.
I'm doing fine.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
Because I don't have time.
Who told you this?
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
So what am I supposed to do?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
[Beat] I do it.
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
What.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Who do you think did it?
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Get a hold of yourself!  You are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry I let you come!
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
I always knew that.
Can't it go to any office?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
What?
Who is it?
Why now, Jimmy?
In the back?
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
But you think he fools around.
I heard that.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
You are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  Imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  He is a lucky man.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Well, I just...
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Try to.
Litterbug.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
I... I...
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Gosh.  It sure is.
Thelma!
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
I know.  I know what you mean.  I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
Does that mean suck my dick?
Where?!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Fuck that.
Hi there!  You alright?
Grrrreat!
Yeah, but he was successful.
I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Oh come on, why would I lie?
'That right?
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Same here again.
How'd you know that?
-- He's in a cage?!
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
That...? Vestibule.
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
-- Love story of our time.
You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Warren!
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Sure.
Who the hell's Woogie?
You want her dead, don't you?
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
So she's married?
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
What do you mean?
How'd you manage that one?
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Puffy, get over here.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
The prom -- you going?
Are you all right?
Who's that?
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
On your ear, you've got something.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
Yeah, sure.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
You got what stuck?
It.
I think a little of both.
Is that bubble what I think it is?
Eh.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
We can't do that, Bobby.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
It shouldn't have. But it did.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
This is about Cuba.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
Damn right I'm scared.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
Oh, yeah -- right.
Sioux Indian, right?
Who are you?
Good. Thank you.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
Cuz I want New York.
Let the press through.
You're steppin' on sign.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
What'd you expect to hear?
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
Who did?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
How so?
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
Why not?
For what?
Apology acknowledged.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Yes. I'll give you that!
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Uh hum.
What plane.
Anything.
You ever think about killing another human being?
Winston Churchill.
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
And now I want you.
That's not what I hear.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
What?
I know exactly what you mean.
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Yes sir!
ROGER, COUGAR.  Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
YEAH, COUGAR?
Let's hope you're right!
This is crazy!
You're crazy. We're level.
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
Not anymore.
Roger, I've got it.
280, 290, 300 knots.
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
Just relax.
Why do they call you Wolf?
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Just once, if they take your plane away.
I want him!
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
They should have warned you about that one.
Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
No. You can be mine!
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
But you continued to fight.
Some guys never get it back.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
I don't know...
I'm nothing like him.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
Man don't know if he's been to Mars or not
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
I am Quaid.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Come on...put his head in place.
Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Arrest that woman!
O.K., everybody pull out!
Where's Kuato?
You're Kuato, right?
Level 2.  Galleria.
Do what?
And you believe him?
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Let me finish!
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
I'm honored.
What's in the two week package?
As real as any memory in your head.
What's he talking about?
This is too weird.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
You two-faced-bastard.
Aliens built it.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
What?
Some kind of mutation...?
Ready as we'll ever be.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Well, sure.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
Yeah, sure.  Go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
You got that right.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
I think we wait right here.
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
Not yet, not yet...
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
The con...!  Oh my God.
God, what a stink!
Okay, ten dollars.
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
I have to talk to your brother.
Sustained.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Not at all --
Of course.
I feel much better now.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
I'm not that desperate.
What's Art Esparza?
I've seen this picture before.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
...Okay...
How can I tell you what I don't know!
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
No, s-sir.
Don Reynard.
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
Argumentative.
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
No? Then what did he say?
-- Eddie told you?
No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.
I'm Roger Baron. I work with Edward Dowd.
That's right.
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
You said, "Teresa Banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
I want you.
I want you to kill for me.
The stuff we got last night.
Bobby...
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
Thank you, Carl.
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Where's Hap?
He's dead -- good and dead.
No.
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
That's what I heard.
That's good.
I don't know, Sam.
Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
Thanks.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Laura, I am your friend.
You're not mad at me?
WE got it back, that's all.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Send me a kiss.
Let's go all the way.
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
We were supposed to be together.
You know it and I know it.
When he finds out.
No.
I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.
I understand.
What?
Sure you do, it's good for you.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Look at this finger here.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
I don't know.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Ah. How did they treat you?
What did he find?
How good's your intelligence?
As far as we know, nothing.
Four cases in three years...
The man's an ambulance chaser...
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
We thought it was just.
You thought it was just.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
You would not...?
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
How is that?
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
Yes.
When she...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
That's what I'd planned to...
No, you did fine.
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Yes.
You're going to settle out of court?
I understand.
Who told you that?
Yes.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Are you done?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Why?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
Is this a bad time.
...and is that serious?
I... do you want me to leave?
If I don't 'grow up...'
What are you going to do?
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
You know what happened.
And ask me what?
Then why don't you testify?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Uh...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
What?
...I have to stand up for her...
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
They still have to take it to a jury.
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
Read me what she said.
...one of the other nurses?
The broad has disappeared...
She told me.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
He's top man in astro and nuclear physics.  He knows all about meteors!
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
Sure...get in!
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
It's gone now.
Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
Have you got a pocket compass?
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
That's because we want a chance to observe them.  This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them.  What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington.  You've deployed your forces well.
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
Can I read it?
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
I don't follow.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
What?  What kind of episode?
Like what?
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
Everything is not fine!
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
Bye.
Right.
Coming for you...
Here.
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
When do you think it'll be done?
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
They wouldn't let me...
Then what is he doing?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
Just take a minute.  You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Not yet.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Well, that's all part of it.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
How old are you, son?
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
No, I can't.
Whatever.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
You've gotta be kidding.  Get the fuck outta my way!
Believe what?
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
Congratulations.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
It was a bad dream...
I know enough.
Passport?
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I'm just sorry you got chewed out.
That's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  Who wants to know?
I couldn't.
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
So is violating international law.
That is unfortunate.  We'll have to take him with us.
Twice.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Shut up donut.
Read on, young John.  Read on. College boards are coming.
Aaauuuhhh!!!
I can't be sure.
They are much more than that, sir.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
For killing a dolphin.
I understand.
It wasn't hard.
No.  I didn't.
Then what are you trying to say then?
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
We don't have no paper bags.
Get out.
Fuck me.
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Was in all the papers three years ago. I'm seventy-six, was only seventy- three then. Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings. Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted 'em killed.
What happened on the charges?
In many capacities.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
What?
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
That bastard Pucinski...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
You ain't actin', mama.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Peanut...
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
Here she goes again...
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
You up for that?
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Yeah.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
You knew my daddy?
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
How'd you know my daddy?
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
You sick?
Yeah?
I'll come along.
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
That was in Vietnam.
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
Lead the way.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
I'll bet.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
What if I asked you not to?
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
Santos... It isn't.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
He was trying to steal my car!
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
He is. Take my word for it.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He lives with his mother.
Because... because...
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Only in your bones?
Which is?
Competence.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
So what's the problem?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
Do you know he won't expel him?
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
You did.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
No! What gave you that idea?
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Well...
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
What'd he say?
Who?
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
Kinship.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Not you. Your talent.
The hell I am.
I never said that.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Yes, James.
Just checking.
I thank you.
I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
Oh. Well. I...
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
Who does?
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
You heard? How?
What's he doing out there?
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
Why yes. How did you know?
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
I... I...
Her husband.
Only when I'm working.
I was thinking of you.
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
That's all right. We'll find him.
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
Five years.
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
Something wrong with that?
Annette? She's good... tense.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
No thanks.
You should hear the bird.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Cop.
Unusual design for a contemporary piece.
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
No.
I was asleep.
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
I'm adjusting okay.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Ms. Kramer.
I can't.
Yes you can, Robin.
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
The job's okay.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
Why not?
Honest? No.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Forget it.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
I'm not that crazy.
Will I ever be normal?
What is your idea of being a Jew?
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
It was a small house.
Are you okay?
I thought you were a dyke.
I'll buy a plant.
Yeah, they could.
So... what's your dark secret?
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
I thought I'd stay the night.
The worst?
Yeah.
How many girls did you molest?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Why young girls, Walter?
Their power. They seduce me.
Are you serious?
I'm not scared.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Why's it always my fucking problem?
Yeah.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Not in this thing.
How?
We've only got one suit.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
Let's go, guys.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Wait for what?
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
Four or five days.
But how could you say such a thing?
You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
Maybe you'd better ask him.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
Yes, maybe that is better.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Who knows why they all left...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
And why did you drop them?
What! Get married?
Aren't you going to change?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Please, do come... Don't leave me alone with him. He's capable of... I don't know... Have you noticed his eyes?
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
There too...
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
It wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Yes, we will.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
I would like to ask you something.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Is that possible?
Why?
No.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Who told you this?
Agnes...
Why?
Yes, Mother.
Say it!
Who?
Oh, I know he does.
Would you like to talk about it?
I don't know.
Did it hurt?
And what did you do?
Where did the baby come from?
Where'd it come from before that?
Are you married?
Would you like some?
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
What else did she tell you?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Did your mother see angels often?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Like you?
A mistake...
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
I was a mistake.
Everything... I don't have children.
Agnes...
I breathed!
You can tell me.
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Yes.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Did you want it to come out?
No.
It grew.
She made me promise not to.
Who?
I don't know which one 
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
Do you remember what just happened?
For what he made me go through.
Who?
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
Why?
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Uh huh.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
Who was the father?
And you didn't try to find out who?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
It's possible isn't it?
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
She has it now.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
I am...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Visitors to the convent.
Do you know what she did to her?
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
Because I didn't know... 
I haven't decided yet.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
No, it reminds me.
All right?
Hand rolled.
Mary Magdelen?
Listen to her singing.
You're what?
For Agnes.
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
My God, you're as crazy as...
Well give me a reasonable explanation
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Hasn't she had enough?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
They are?
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Y'what?
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Oh, it's all right.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Sorry? 
You do - repeatedly.
No. I don't.
Get him out of here!!
I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
You crawler.
The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
I've got you worried, haven't I?
How'd you guess?
Are you pulling my leg?
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
I'm not ...
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Why selfish?
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
And cunning.
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
Books are good!
What's that mean?
Yeah ... that's right.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
What?
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
Eh?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
Every morning.
But I'm clean.
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
Here, Pauly.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Well, I've got me gob stopper.  Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
Ah, go on, you swine.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
Well you're not going.
You wouldn't!
Well, you look like him.
That's what you tell me.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
He'll get over it.
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Sorry.
I'll set John on you!
I'm not kidding.  You can get one if you have the credit.  Look just like real cows, too.
Hell, we're equipped --
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
But functioning.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
A transmission?
Has the hull been breached?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Right.
And be right back.
How does he breathe?
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
Boy, that's terrific.
Yes.
Can you do anything for him?
Thing is, I'm about out of fuel.
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
You will notice, though, that there are no more phases.  Only four forms are shown.  After that the pattern repeats.
It's not going to work.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Can you see anything?
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Okay.
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
It appears to be some sort of spacecraft.  We're going to approach it.
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
No, I had to seal off a whole section.  We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
Kablooey.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
What?
York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
What's the problem?
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
How many... how many people are missing?
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
What do you mean?
What can I do?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
You got it, cowboy.
And what is your name?
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
Please do.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Just like that.
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
Yes, Addison.
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Frankly, I don't remember.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
I'm a junk yard.
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
How is Eve? Okay?
Okay.
This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-!
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
So she seems.
I don't think that's funny!
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
Don't mix your metaphors.
It's not nonsense.
I don't have to. I want to.
And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense...  ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin...
Are you proud of me, Bill?
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
So am I.
What have I got to do with it?
Everything.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
Find out.
I never played Fort Sumter.
Oh, brother.
I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
She's loyal and efficient-
Like an agent with one client.
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Late for what?
Don't be dense. The party.
She's got to meet you-
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
Something most important you can do.
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
Thank you, Karen.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
'Remembrance'.
No trouble at all.
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
Ain't it the truth?
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
Harrington.
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
Peace and quit is for libraries.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
What about Bill?
Check.
Loud.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
In a minute...
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
I'm beginning to catch up.
For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise-
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
The play? All right, I guess...
Twentyish. It isn't important.
I never said it was!
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
I placed...?
But what could she do?
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
I said I'm a dying man!
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
--no way--
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb--  --listen, that was a Watergate question--
--a spy, you mean?
About the past year.
--fifteen phone calls--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
--you do?--with access to records?
Were you eyebrow reading?
Anything you've got.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
You want me to be the bastard.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
Nothing--I just found out that Jeb Magruder from CREEP is a bigger bike freak than I am.  I never like it when the other guy's human...
--has he got an ax?--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
How high up, which Republicans?
--Haldeman I know, who else?
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
I'm on deadline.
--that was awhile ago--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Give me your checkbook then.
Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
Who by?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
I will not talk about the other two.
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
--I'm not here.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Government. Recently retired.
Nobody ever had too much.
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Do I have to?
What's your middle name?
Come on!  I won't tell.
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
Because I want to.
So you're going to Michigan?
What's that?
Then don't.
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
I do, baby, I do.
Yeah, that's right.
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
Nothing!
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Whatever you want.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Don't you want me to?
She's a mermaid, dude.
Me?
Well...uh...
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Tonight?
Okay, don't stop.
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
Yeah.
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
But you better hurry.
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
And who's Claude?
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
Shit. What have I done?  Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
Why isn't it doing anything!?
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Why the fuck would I do that?
Because Gaston was after it.
Sort of...
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
Now!
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Hmmph. At least now there's one person around here who doesn't think I'm crazy.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
When you're older . . .
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
What happened to your parents?
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
Why?
Trying... to... breathe...
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
The dessert fork!
How do you know?
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
I cursed then all!
You'd lose your security deposit?
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Are you feeling all right?
What do you mean?
Promise me she'll have her home.
I had nothing to do with it!
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
What?
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Who are you?
Alvy.
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
I-you know, I don't wanna.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Okay, that's good.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Oh.
Yeah, I know.
I'll see yuh.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
what I mean?
think that's, uh-
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.
And blind people, crippled...
Oh! Italian, right?
You- Do you love me?
Of course.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
M'hm.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
M'm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Sinatra?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Will it change my life?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
I'm following you and David, if you-
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
Very big spider.
Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
I don't know.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
What thing?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
I'm cool.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
The what?
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
What-
My head is throbbing.
You have a raccoon?
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
We can show her the schoolyard.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Oh, Jesus.
What difference does that make?
How do you like this couple, Max?
Hi. How do you do.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
But she's colored.
SO?
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
I was very charming.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Oh yes.
It has your ring.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
I have a small window of time.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
Why didn't you bring him?
To dander.  Otis.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
Yeah.
It's not a contest.
I never put myself in harm's way.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
You really need to be fucked.
And?
Are you my big hard hero?
Hm.  We should do it again.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
They're paying him scale.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
Okay, knock it off.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Or shitty!!  Otis!!
That is not true.
About me!
Anyone else?
Lovely.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
It's Jerry's worst idea.
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
A little out of my element.
No you're not.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
What am I, five?
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
And he doesn't smoke?
How long have you been married?
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
Trust him.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
I did it.
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
The charades.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Yeah.
Very.
Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
You don't know she's a bitch.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Thanks.
Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it?
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
So where should I put it?
I trust you.
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
And only you can become a Queen?
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
You held onto this all that time?
Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
Don't get all sappy about it!
That's correct, sir!
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
You're a real buddy.
Something the matter?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Care to make a small wager?
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Oh, I never catch colds.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
No.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
You're so right.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Much better.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
No -- I don't want anything.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
Something wrong with your legs?
They had to pump it out.
You don't have to entertain me.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Was he really upset when you told him?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
I would.
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
Thank you.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I guess so.
Cheers.
You don't have to if you don't want to --
So I want you to keep a clear head.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
Mind if I come in?
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Who?
Oh.
Not that I have anything to hide.
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
I know how it is.
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
Who else?
Mr. Sheldrake?
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
What do I -- ?  Just a minute.
No!
Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Let me get my bag.
What's her address?  Where does she live?
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
What's this -- you packing?
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
No.
Not particularly.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Who?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Doctor.
You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Are you sure that's what you want?
You know I do.
Now, Fran --
Yeah, we better.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.
I told you -- with my mother.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
See if they'll what?
Well --
That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men --
Sort of.
Let's talk about you.
I was an FO for the 25th.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Why they call you that?
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
Looks that way.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
The draft of that river might be too shallow on the point.
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
When'd you do it?
Yeah -- like keep out --
Listen.
Which way? Right or left?
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Charlie?
No, sir.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Sure -- fine --
What?
Take her in low, Lieutenant.
Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
Haiphong.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
What about this point here?
The enemy. Who else?
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
How's the pain?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
When?
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Cognac?
Well who the hell verifies that ?
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Son of a bitch, sir.
I'll get you there all right.
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
Keep back.
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
I don't want to talk any more.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
-- Permanently?
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
Send him down to her.  There's money in my duffel bag, back at his cabin.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Forget it.  It would take days.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.
Shut up!
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Any idea who could've done it?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
We were just talking about him.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
I want us to go out.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
My son is sick, okay?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Just how grateful I am.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I want you to go on this trip.
No, sir...
My son.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Fries.
Here's the trouble with never.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
It was a mistake.
To hell with sex.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I don't.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
Yeah... Well...
What are you doing here?
What a break...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
You know what? I...
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
How to die, mostly.
Good night.
What are you trying to do to me?
Okay by me.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
Well, I can't reach them.
Well, that's a load off.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Go away.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
I love you.
Because...  ... you love her?
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
I know just what you mean.  I'm pretty beat myself.
Probably.
Okay, don't.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Why don't you tell me.
What?
Yes, sir.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
I'm part of the game, just like you.
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
'Them'?
Another contractor.
He wants to kill you?
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
No.  Just the first one.
After that?
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
Not even a stalemate?
What happens if you do?
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
The beach?  It was nice.
Taiwan.
Fine.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
What happened?
What did he want?
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
Yes.  Here I am again.
I think I got one today.
No?
Why?
And you were drilling these holes...?
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
That's a ridiculous move.
Why?
Both.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
What?
Yes.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
Electra --
Yes.  Please come in.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Shit... oh well.
Taken.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
What do other guys do?
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
American currency.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
Like you?
Because it's in English?
An alternative literary venue!
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
It's big, right Jahn?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
You got my word on it.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
We don't speak Czech!
No, We aren't going to do it.
She's cool.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
What?
You capitalist pig!
The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
What happened?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
What?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Follow that Budjovice sign.
So am I.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
How about you Brutus?
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
So, we won't be going to London?
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
Will this thing take long?
No, it should be over soon.
Thanks.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
It's Josh's.
It was the biggest I could find.
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
No problem, is it at your place?
Why?
You bastard!
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
With you.
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
Yeah.
You sleeping with her?
I could take after Dad, too.
What kind of a man are you, son?
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
-- Obviously.
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
-- Your act only works with an audience.
Like me.
Maybe a little of both.
Go for it.
You want to tell me...
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Then maybe you can read mine.
I don't want to be just your friend --
You don't know what you want --
I have to get you home by one.
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
The truth. I just left you out of it.
Where's the one you're building?
What are you going to -- ?
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
I should have told you sooner --
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Nothing.
'Find out who you are and do it on purpose.' Dolly Parton.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
But if you could, you would?
Yes.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Materially or spiritually?
How -- how long does she have?
I thought she built it herself.
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
Then you remember more than I do.
Uh, yes, sir...
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Uh, thanks...
Poly-what?
Have we ever met before?
Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
What's this all about?
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Oh -- Marty -- what time did you say it was?
Pro, the sun's out!
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
So what? We'd be rich!
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
What if you lost your keys?
Professor, be serious, would you?
You did what?!?
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
Dick? Dick who?
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Can't afford to take chances.
You don't mind?
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
Does he bite?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Mmmmm.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Is that right?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
Holly.
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
Sure.
Quit my job.
Great.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Well, I got homework.
Just don't... I've got a headache.
What?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
But it would hurt.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
This your place?
Fine.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
Just gimme a chance.
Hold it right there.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
First thing I did.
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
The deuce you say.  That crate!
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
Let her out. In my custody.
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
To get my guns.
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Go away.  Let me rot?
Which?  The one in my throat.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Absolutely.
What's happening with my call to SAC?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Why me?
Bill –
Well as a matter of fact, I write for the pictures.
So be it.
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
To see pap.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
And I could tell you some stories –
See you, Charlie.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Seems like nothing but, lately.
What do you think happened?
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
I tried to show you something beautiful.  Something about all of US –
Must be.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Uh-huh.
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
How about the coke?
Thank you.
She said what you said she'd say.
I thought you quit.
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
I have nothing to hide.
You know all about me.
No, thanks.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
What's it about?
To see if I can get away with it.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I don't have a choice.
Make love to me.
I don't know.
I'll convince you.
Did you?  What's she doing?
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
Liar.
Why?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Cocaine.
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
Were there ever any suspects?
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
I'm a smart sonofabitch.  I just hide it.
Hallelujah.
I feel fine!
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
What was it?
We bring her in for questioning.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
Yes I did.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
It's in New Jersey.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
I don't like beer.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
Annina Nosei.
You name it, I paint there.
How about right now?
I know.
I need a dealer.
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
Tell me about it. What are you angry about?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
What's wrong with you today?
Oh yeah..
Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny.  "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken!
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Who's John Henry?
Hi Gina.
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
I guess you did.
Guess I just got sick of him.
What who's saying?
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee –
Hi.
Don't you think he's using you?
You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
No, I'd like the scarf.
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Jean Michel Basquiat.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
I didn't know.
I think I'll take the stairs.
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
You'll never guess.
...four, five.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Dad!  Save yourself!
My lips are sealed.
"You're doin' great, Mayor Cobblepot."  "Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."  "I need you, Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
I guess, the truth is I'm just not comfortable with the idle rich.  Even when they try to act like heroes.
You'd be surprised.
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
But soon...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
I wish I knew.
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
Dick, don't push me right now.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
You lie!
I find that unlikely.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
One kiss, my love.  For luck.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
Well, I can respect your opinion.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Apology hastily retracted.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
Is he all right?
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
There's one other thing. I feel..
...Afraid.
Mystery.
And another name for Mystery?
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Tonight's a good night.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
My life's an open book. You read?
You are direct, aren't you?
What? Ah yes. Of course. I'm sorry. It's just that...you're my idol.  And some people have been trying to keep us apart.
Wait. You can't go.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
Excuse me.
Well, I met someone...
Sorry. I haven't even had time to unpack. Instant coffee okay?
I'm not-
I don't want to remember!
You do know. Try.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
Chase is coming for dinner. Why don't you join us.
How could I forget?
Fred?
What the hell is going on here?
What say we flip for it?
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
About what?
You're a genius.
Alexander Knox. Gotham Globe.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
Take me. Let the boy go.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
What is it you want?
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
I've considered that possibility.
That's it.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
Honey - - I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale.  If I had a good enough hint.
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
Allie, he's not.
He's not crazy.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Yeah. Deja vu.
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
Holy shit. Holy...
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
And what did you say?
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
Yes.  Great.  Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.
Thanks, Annie.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
You're not going to ....
And a car.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
Yes?
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
You mean there's mre than one?
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Turd-burglar...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Really? I poop too much.
Heh heh, thanks.
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
Deep and hard.
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Who knows?
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Look at the publisher.  Handbook for the Recently Deceased Press.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
What's she doing here?
That's all we need.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
... Yes this must be him.  Look... Betelgeuse... Betelgeuse...
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
I didn't --
Little black party dresses?
Is this like a trick question?
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Are you Juno, our case worker?
We need help.  We deserve help.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
I want to be dead too.
And live in what, our station wagon?
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
That's it!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
Just <u>say</u> it.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Not these people!  They are ruthless!
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans.  You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
I thought I saw something.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Look at the tiny figures.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
Hardly any, Robert.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
No. I like it here.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Oh, I like that very much.
Yes, so do we.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
I agree.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
I understand.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
Yes.
... Oh.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
I agree.
Very good.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Yes. That is surprising.
I hope so.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Which view?
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
You heard?
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Yes, ma'am.
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Good. Anything else?
That could be possible...
Thank you, Colonel.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Oh, I will, and I have many, many friends and associates, my friend. All, by the way, in Overeaters Anonymous. All of them fat and alone like me, all of them dream of being someone else, all of them with John Malkovich as their second choice!
We have to make it an early night.
Hmmm.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
You fell in love with her first.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
Let me try!
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
No. I understand perfectly.
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Emily Dickinson.
Who told you?
Who told you?
Just.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I've fallen in love.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
You're evil, Maxine.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Hush, sweetheart.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
Count me in.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
What want ye, girl child?
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Yes?
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
Thank you.
I will.
No. I mean work work.
No..No that won't do...
Could be that fall you took.
That was fun.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
Till she showed herself.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
He knew Baby Suggs?
You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
You planning to do anything about it?
You don't know what I think.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Yes sir..You right about that. That's just what I come over to talk to him about. Just that..
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
You're not dealing with morons here.
It's the LeBaron.
Uh-huh.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
The?  Who the fff--
Fuck you.
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
No--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
Yes, uh, very impressive.
Please!  Please!
Far out.
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
On you, maybe.
I thought you might know, man.
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
I want you to see him immediately.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
Well...no, of course not--
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
What the fuck are you--
Hey Walter--
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
Just for making the hand-off?
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
The fucking point is--
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
What the fuck is going on there?
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
Walter, please--
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Look, man, did you--
Is the car out front yours?
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Huh?
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
He can't walk, Walter!
Yeah.
So no funny stuff.  Okay?
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
Is this a--what day is this?
Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake.  A fucking goldbricker.
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Bullshit. Walter!
He's half yours, partner.
I haven't forgotten.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
Time.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
I don't think so.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Sounds like a plan.
I don't like it.
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Us?  What are you talking about?
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you, though?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
You should've killed her, then.
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
You're blind --
You used me as bait?!
It worked, didn't it?
Look closer.
Blade --
I've been better --
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
What are you talking about?
I'm not leaving without you.
No --
But you use blood banks --
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
How?
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
What do you mean?
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
That's a joke?
That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
--whatever; that's her.
You don't want it though.
--fine, later, fine.
--scared the living shit out of us.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
The, uh, blur there.
What? That made her lose the baby?
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
I do.
--Cotter: shut up.
Heather, does that look like Domini there?
--I don't know.
--Graduate Thesis--
--oh, Jesus--
Enough to keep sane.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
You planning on sleeping out there?
Why she kills children.
Still working on it.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
I am?
Where... where you going?
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
You wouldn't be putting me out.
...You ever get tired?
Yeah...
Marty.
Isn't that what you want?
What do you want to know?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Most of the night...
The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money...
I want you to go fishing.
Right. Sorry.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Is Sandy part of this?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Hello, daddy.
Alright, suit yourself.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Nobody.
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
Well.
What do you want?
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
I'm alright. go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
Who's it, you mean.
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
You. what?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Yes.
Terrible. boring.
What else is new?. right?
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
Yeah?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Sandy. this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Probably not. no. Why?
Are you feeling okay?
Well.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
... Stop it Mike.
Motherfucker works fast.
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
What?  Yeah, sure.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
The coca is my responsibility!
Excuse me?
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
Sell it?
What's that?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
What kind of project?
Now do you see what I am saying?
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Touche.
Yeah.  You do the talking.
I love you too, man.
I did not.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
Diego is my brother.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Tough spot.
Not mad.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Good.
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Tuna.
Figured what out?
She did that before.
What?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
Dad.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
I'll be here.
I know, Dad.  I know...
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. If I were in their place, I would use bombs.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
And here?
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
I'll explain.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
No, and neither were my men.
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
Because it hasn't all been erased.
Then you can go.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
What was the nature of the argument?
She planned this.  She wanted us to find the nasal spray.
Your Honor -- please!
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
No.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Yes.
Intense.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
She was.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
No.
Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
What happened?
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
Yes.
Three fifteen.
Frank -- what are you doing here?
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
Yes.
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
Why not?
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
Why didn't you live together?
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I went out on the boat.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
Why?
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Maybe you don't know what it's like where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but I do.  I came from a neighborhood just like hers.  This is a whole other world for her.  She's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people.  So, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.  Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom -- your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
What's wrong?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
I'm not.
No.
Please -- not now.
Sorry.
Well, that's a long time.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Doesn't matter. Move on.
Why are there two deeds here?
Well, I can help.
Mom's orders.
What?
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
Oh, yes.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
That must be it. It's a great smell.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
Francesca.
Oh. How old?
And clean.
Much.
Then what happened?
Oh you!
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
No. I'll do them later.
Francesca?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
But no one in particular.
But it's not the same.
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
Yeah. See you later.
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
Couple. Want to help?
No.
Why do you say that?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
No.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
What do you want me to say?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Frannie.
I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
Yes, they are.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Wh-wh-whooo?
What it will be.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Just try it.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Hush, baby.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
Why?
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
From what?
Daddy?
What building?
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
I didn't sell it.
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
How many times I told you, no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit, I'm the one that does it.
That's all we did, steal their ride.
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
Post-toasted's more like it.
That building?
Should I?
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
You don't need a key.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
What are you going to do with it?
There's no time.
Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
It couldn't have been.
Caesar, maybe we should run --
The money?  The money's gone.
No.
What happened to them?
Who are you going to call?
Shut up, Violet!
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
You murdered Gino!
I should be going.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
No.
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
What?  They ain't there?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
A favor?
Are they really?
You're doing everything yourself?
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
I knew it.
Not exactly.
Why?
Basically.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
Because it's the truth.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
I think so, too.
How much money?
I am, but ...
I think ...
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
Thank you.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
You're asking me a direct question?
I thought you were never going to do that.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
I'm not asking.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
-- if we can get a clean shot --
Forget it.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Jason Bourne is dead.
MPG Capital.
Look, maybe I should just...
Yeah, I know...
Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
-- sir? --
You are a friend of his?
Yes.
Oh, Jesus... 
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I was shot twice in the back.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
I thought about it.  I don't know.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
xxxxxx
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
How did I get here?
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
Machines don't fix themselves.
... fix themselves.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Oh, right ...
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
Well ... well, I ...
Even later.
Layton! Oh shit!
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Out of kindness.
They weren't at school with us.
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
We don't make mistakes.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Where do I get it stamped?
Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
Don't look back! Act naturally!
No.
It's my fucking life.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
It does doesn't it?
We've got both.
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
What?
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Leave me alone!
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Tuttle?
Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
Actually, I've decided ...
I ... uh ...
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
Hello. Mr Lowry?
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Fixed?
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
What?
Are you saying this is illegal?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Time to go.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
Pregnant.
No, no, that's impossible.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
No. He's dead.
What's his name?
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
At least he's got people around him.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
He's working a double shift.
How is she?
Okay.
I need to sit down a minute.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
There's no time.
I think the worst is over.
It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. 
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
That's too many.
I quit! I'm through!
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
How can that be? He was getting better.
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
I never felt better in my life.
Who with?
What do you want to break?
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Okay, whatta I do?
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
You learn that in the army?
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
You're burned out.
Faster!
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
And the rule was...
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
Why?  What did they do to you?
London.
London.  That's a promotion!
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
Why?
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Yes.
Ravenous homosexual.
Eleven and a half.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
I'm going to take it.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Outside?
Yeah --
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
We could...
One's enough.
What?
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
...good-bye then.
Go ahead.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
I was a lot earlier.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
How's it going?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it.  There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
Oh, good.
We can go together.
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Well, when?
Yes.
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
How can you say that to me?
I got promoted for things like that.
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
...that way we have someplace to go when we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Oh it's enough...
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
What did he do?
He made a cat.
It wasn't easy.
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Oh yeah?
Better!
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Just about anything, Walter.
When did you make this, Walter?
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Oh come on!  Even you can see its value.
I do the research.
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
Dead Cat?
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Have a seat -
Yeah?
Uh, hi.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
You are?
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
Good morning Walter!
Here here!
I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
Well yes I guess I have been Mrs. Swicker.  Somebody's got to.
Cheer up.  You may still.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
What's with you?
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Amazing!
You didn't like them.
Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me.
Let me in.
Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
I'm hungry.
Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
Yeah?
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
I do?  I guess I do.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
No...
I am so sure.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Thanks.
Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
I should have known.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
Please.  It's so '91.
I'm looking for you, actually.
All right.  What do we do now?
Our purposes.
Oh, him.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Uh... gym.
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Sporting events, yeah.
But you threw a knife at my head!
My nails.
What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Football is my life.
Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
Thank you very much.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
You are much more.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Throw it out.
Buffy?
Hey, wait a minute...
Right!
Nice much.
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
You can learn to like it.
Gimme the God damn ball!
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
I think you're real cute.
What'd he say?
it's okay..
--but you're father's in there!
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Oh my...  Don't leave...
You're pulling your hips out.
But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
You got me all confused.
Don't you think I'm pretty?
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
It was a cocksucking call!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
How?
What do I got?
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
Yep.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
Fear and ignorance.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
We're getting married.
It's a league record.
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
Hello, Senator.
That's right.
Liar.
You were wandering around.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
The worst was Blue.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Speeding?
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Mommy.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
They payin'?
Hey.
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
All right, Ace?
Nope, there's no way.
Listen...
You should say so.
Yeah.
All right.
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
...to me.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
It's none of my business?
Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
And at the...
What people?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
What are you -
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
Sammy.
Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Half - I'm comin' down. 
We can't get rid of him?
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to you later. Just - You - You got a gun at home? Yeah. Bring it over here right away.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
You're with me now.
Yeah.
You sure?
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
...they didn't know what really moved her.
Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
It's under...
And...
All right...
He wanted a watch, too.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
You threw it away?
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
What'd you have?
Why do you want to do that?
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I was with somebody.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
I am not!
Not gonna let me in?
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
Oh, you are...
Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
Bullshit! Bullshit!
Eight children! 
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
This is not the way to treat people.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Green?
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks.
We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Sam?
Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
I can't.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Yeah. Fuck him.
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
For what?
It's in all the papers.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Am I right?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
I know what you mean.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
All right?
Bye.
What? What?
Nothin'.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Exactly.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
It's what you want?
Well, you know...
What's the matter?
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
I'm here.
Promise?
You do?
Okay, then.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
Lester - he called you here.
Here.
Yes, don't worry.
All right.
Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live with her.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Two.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
This is Nick.
Pleasure.
It's up to you.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Go fuck yourself.
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot.
Charlie M.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
You sure?
What's the matter with you?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
I'm sorry.
I know, but that's enough.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
What do you want from me?
Well. I stand corrected.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
You mean, "Consuela" is a good mother..
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
How much?
Oh now this one is mine...
You are...
I don't know if I can do it alone.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!
Or relieve me of it later.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
You never miss a trick.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
And stop with the directions.
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
I don't believe you.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Oh won't I?
Where'd they take you to?
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Another minute.
What are you doing now?
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Sometimes I paint.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I'm trying to.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Did you hear that click?
What did you do?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
They put their hands all over me.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
He wants 75 back.
Did you hear that?
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
What's Nels' number?
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
Why are we stopping?
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
How about "later?"
That's how it's going to be.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Took preparation.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
There are no guarantees in this life.
Pass.
308-9962.
Stay there.
You'll see her.
I don't know what you mean.
Negative.
And then?
Call me "Nels."
It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  Tell the man.
Five minutes.
In your dreams.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Hold on.
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
He's what she should run a mile from.
I've no thoughts on the subject.
Persistent.
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
Cunt.
Please, Dil --
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
He wants to know do I mean that.
It's a simple question.
Your Pat just cost me two hundred quid.
How'd you guess?
Not me.
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
Hi. You forgot your bag.
You know.
The one you gave me in the Metro.
Yes...
I think you do.
You say that like a gentleman.
Something I heard someone say once.
No, depends on nothing.
I'm thinking of your man.
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
Never said a truer word.
Will you meet me again?
A little.
Sorry.
Only if you kiss me.
So I got it wrong, then.
Not at all, honey.
You following me?
You got the keys to the shop?
No! I'm going home...
I will be.
Died...
Don't you want to kill me?
Let me go, Dil
I like you, DIl
What would you do for me?
I know you're lying, Jimmy, but it's nice to hear it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Carnations.
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Leave me alone, Jude.
Suits you.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
So?
Would make me feel better about it.
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
I thought it was Dave.
I understand.
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
Well, I could say the same about you.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
They won't let him die.
What do you know about my nature?
No?
Suppose you could say that.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
You could have said no.
Best game in the world.
Jody's always right.
My special friend.
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
I told you not to talk that way --
When I was a child...
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --
What?
Tell me, Jody
People. They could be looking.
Nice lady.
You shut your face --
He's a good soldier, Jude.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
Well -- come on.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Yes, you told me.
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
Can you remember anything at all?
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
Don't be an idiot!
Agent.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
May I have a sandwich, please?
Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Describe him.
But no one actually saw him die.
Oh. Then who's this one?
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
No, thank heaven.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Brian.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
Okay -- up there.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
That's the idea.
It's all right with us --
I met a man with sharp nails.
Scobie?
There -- you're a new man.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Reggie -- listen to me --
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
I'm sorry.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
No --
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
I don't believe it.
And the last one?
The kid said --
I don't know anything.
I know.  I'm sorry.
And this?
We won! We won!
How did you find out?
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
We'll find you a hotel.
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Good night.
You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
But what?
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
The American Embassy.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
What?
We will separate -- you look over there.
Why?
Calm down Brent.
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
How much further?
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
Did you warn her?
She's not here.
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
Can you get inside?
I can.
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Yes.
Mark Shale.
Why?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Did Sharon say no?
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Yeah. Who is she?
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
Kenny's aunt?
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
I'm worried about someone.
Ok.
What?
If sheep don't count.
That wasn't me ...
At least somebody likes this shit.

...shit.
INT. ANDY'S ICE CREAM FACTORY/ANDY'S OFFICE - DAY.
Art.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.

Well, he told me to collect cash.
He could've.  That-That's true.  But that would've been smart...
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
...and a shitload of ice.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.

I got, like, uh....

What the hell's goin' on?
 Excuse me...
Oh, man.
Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
...-er.
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
You stole this truck!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
That's...
I ain't playin' that.
Oh...
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
All right, you got it.

...easy, easy, easy.
All right, you got it, you got it!
Shut up!
...ho!
 Go, go.

Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.

Taking it down the hill.
...here!
What?

You're fucked, man.
...stole the truck.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
...split.

Yeah, baby!
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...


We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
 Okay.
Come on, come on!
...-natic.
 That's why I didn't give it...
Sometimes the prey bites back.

Hang...
...on!
Forty-five seven!
Oh, shit.
What the--?

Who drove the ice cream...
Us.  Owes us.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
That was quick.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...

And it won't be pleasant. 
But...
We do need your truck.
...here.   Mason... 
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
...destroyer of worlds."
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
Pleasant surprise.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
INT. LONG'S CAR - NIGHT.
Check the immediate area.
What about these two?
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...

I assume you have one.
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
Where's Arlo?





...it.
 Two pots of coffee...
Secrets.
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT.
Here's what I want you to do.
Negative.  Negative.

There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...-time. 
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
We've got the real thing!
God!  They're gonna seal it.

So you don't remember...

Jesus.
I'll lead 'em out.


Heat's murder.
Take it easy, Jake.
'Course you do, Jake.
Land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
That's too bad.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
His girlfriend?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Just find the girl.
I've got her.
Yes... I think I can manage...
How do you do that?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but –-
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
Looking for someone.
No.
C'mon I'll show you.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Gittes, stay outta this.
I don't want to drop it.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Well, how much would you like?
How did you find out?
I mean I can't tell you.
That your maiden name?
Another satisfied client's wife.
So you married your father's business partner?
Oh, yeah?
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
The Valley?
Know him?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Yeah.
Bothers everybody who works there, but to me... It was...
...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
Give me an example.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
I want to see her.
...no...
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
She's my sister.
To Mexico...
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
Well, tell him I'll be back.
I don't understand.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
Mr. Gittes...
...Yes of course.
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
He did or he didn't?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!
All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them! 
Toto, come here.
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
But...who...
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
No...
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
He made an awful lot of money.
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
You just made the paper over four times today, Mr. Kane.  That's all -
Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
I'm sure that's it. 
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!
It can wait.
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
You're no Venus de Milo.
I know...  But you do look so silly.
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
Charlie!
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
Oh, yes, the bonus.
You won't be lonely, Charles...
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Was he in love?
Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
Think again!
I'll have a highball.
Am I sure?
How long have you been a smoker?
Okay. I'm sorry about that.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
She said not to come home until graduation.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
Exactly.
There's no light back there.
You're kidding.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
Awww. That was so cute.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
You mean, on a date?
You have a better suggestion?
What about Sing?
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
It wasn't me.
Was it you?
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.
I can whip your ass.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
What's your point?
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
That's what I said.
Why?
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Five years.
That's cheating?
That girl was vile to you.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
Yeah.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
I guess not.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
The milkmaids.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
All of them.
Can you believe this?!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Don't yell at me, pal.
See? There you go again.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
At least we're stuck here together.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
Julie Dwyer died.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
You hate people.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
Stop it.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Balls resting on his lips.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
You want to rent a movie.
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
What?
I like to expand my horizons.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Could be.
My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
I was born.
I should shit or get off the pot.
What are you talking about?
Fuck you.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Leave me alone.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
You need a ride?
To say the least.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
Excuse me?
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old.  Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
Meaning?
I'm trying.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
No, he got hit by a bus.
I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
Here. Now leave me alone.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
Why did you agree to come in then?
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
She called you, didn't she?
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
It better be up to and including me.
You're a pig.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
You!
Why do you say that?
Yeah, right.
That's because I never had sex with him!
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Something like thirty-six.
And that made you feel better?
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
Maybe we should soap your hand or something.
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
What's this?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
He's your cousin?
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
I do about three-fifty, four.
Because he's out of shape.
I like the way you think.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
No, I'm just visiting my man.  Dante, this is Willam Black.  This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
That woulda been cool.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
Love's a killer, isn't it?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
I did what I thought was right.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
I don't understand?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Which could maybe what?
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
What if he can't?
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
What?
This rope is sixty years old!
Never, what?!
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
No, he's gone.
How far?
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Then it's a deal.
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Ask the questions.
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
Thank you, sir.
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
How do you do, sir?
Alex.
Just a manner of speech, sir.
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
As an unmuddied lake, sir. Clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, sir. Deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass. He groans and retches.
I beg your pardon?
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
Crabs?
How're you feeling this morning?
Something like that.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
I just say what the other person would say?
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
How many did I get right?
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
You need a vacation.
Just had one.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
Oh, my, yes.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
So?
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
And you came all the way down here to see me?
It's nothing.
Of course I'm proud.  You know he started with nothing?  Look at him today.  Playing concerts.
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
What's he sayin'?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
Twenty-four minutes.
You prefer nights?
Like what?
You're cool.
I'm cool.
What?
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Who was he?
Tens of thousands killed before sundown.  Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Did you bat an eye, Max?  Join Amnesty International?  No.  I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Why?
No you don't.
I never learned jazz.
I'm not catching a melody.
No.
Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
Dmitri?
Makes two of us.
That's what you said...
What'd they do?
Then what are you?
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
Let her go.
Excuse me?
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
Switch the charts.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Figure of speech.  Could we go?
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
Can you prove any of this?
Who?
How is it possible?
Not this again.
Okay, I will.
What's in Connecticut?
You go.  Send me a postcard.
Did you kill him?
Is that what they told you?
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Why not?
Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
You do?
Top pocket...  Go on.
You think it's a conspiracy?
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Please, sit.
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Agent Lowry?
This doesn't make sense.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
Wasn't my idea.
Yeah, I do.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Meaning...
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Do you have a minute -- ?
Actually I'm running late --
It'll just take a moment.
I don't understand.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
This... seemed best.
Good luck, David.
How soon will you be able to decode it?
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
And a hundred mile airspace.
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
What kind of deal?
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
And in return?
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
I thought you were here because you want to go.
What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
And?
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
You too.
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
Do you love your parents?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
Maybe that's okay.
What?
What are you so afraid of?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Meaning...
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
But --
We work down in the ditch?
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Here, Mom.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
Git to work!
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
That's it. That's the end.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
What you mean, Luke?
I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
Forty-five.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
I want to die.
Look out for her.  She's tougher than you think.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
Gaahhd!  What a <u>cop</u>!  You busted me!  The new one, in the Marina.  She has a police radio scanner. It's always on.  She turns it off, and then she has to turn it on again.  She's obsessed.  She can't not listen to it, but she can't listen to it, so she makes me listen to it.
Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
The door was already open...
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
Who was the man in the basement?
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Why should I trust you?
It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
I'll get a locksmith.
Yes.  I have to go...
Is there a phone booth there?
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Just horseshit luck.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Let's get out of here...
My promise.
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
Yeah, everything's different.
Helen... excuse me, we...
Right.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
We could use a little help.
What the hell you need her for?
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
It's about time.
After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
It does.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
Hard to say.
Yes.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
The case could be made.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
It's hospital policy...
What?
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
But everything's OK?
What about the engagement party?
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
What's the matter?
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
I can't.    I can't see him there.
Wow.   Congratulations.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Tomorrow?
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
A deal's a deal.
Just remember that I love him.
There's a spider in my room.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
Guess.
Don't be ridiculous.
Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
Really?    Me too.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
No way.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
Home free.
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
Thanks.
Steak?
Congratulations.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
Well then why'd it happen?
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
No, it's not like that.
I'm going to the store.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
No.
Sure, I understand.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I'm glad you're doing well.
Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Where are the tapes?
And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
Oui.
What?
You don't trust me?
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
I'm good.   Really.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
But you were there?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
What about the money?
We'll think of something.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
No.   Chicks dig me.
We have to find Sophie.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
You better.
What do you want now?
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Great fuckin' song.
The Holiday Hotel.
What room number?
There must be half a million dollars here though.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.

No!
You see that car?
I know where she went.
Watch this.
J&amp;B?
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
I don't know.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see, this is personal.  Leave her to me.
On guard!
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
And if I use them to kill you?
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
So what if I don't?
I have a guest.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Let's end this here.
Only the sword will settle this.
My comb!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
What was it?
Then, why did you come?
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
But don't be too lenient.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
What does it say?
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
This is a delicate matter.
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
It's just the dope, don't worry
Right.
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
I don't know you...
Take the dope, too.
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
Does it hurt?
Miss her?
Go away.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
"Our" Crow...?
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
You heard me.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
No.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
You implied it.
Shut up.
Why not?
How are you today?
Give it up.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
Lighten up.
Not at all. Have a seat.
Where are you going?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
German.
Doesn't ring a bell.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Okay.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Okay.
Okay.
Did you hide the letters?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
Cool.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
Some other time, Cecile.
Don't you want to change that?
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
And you think she bought it?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
Where is she?!
Ronald?
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
I see your point... though why should I care?
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
Care to make a wager on that?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
Loser.
Okay.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
What's your problem?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
So what went wrong?
You wanted an answer to your question.
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
And if I don't?
Ronald? That's crazy.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
You will be discreet about this?
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
She's out.
I did?
We played backgammon?
Excuse me?
Oh... no thank you...
She really loves me.
What are you talking about?
You bastard!
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
Did you ever make a wish?
Irena.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
All right, mommy.
I think I should.  3000W?
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Yes, daddy.
I didn't forget.
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
But where do you come from?
For as long as you'll let me.
Your children?
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
May I pet the deer?
Don't cry, Amy.
She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
Wait a minute. Listen.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
Yeah but they looked cool...
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
Never felt better.
I mean where on your body?
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
People notice you Frida.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
Only to see.
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
I wonder if he's married.
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
DON'T call the police.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over.
I didn't have to pee then.
So pee? Here?
I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy?
Coffee and...
Your desk.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No?
Very well then. Is that all?
Used to? Did it stop finally?
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
They do? Oh no...
No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately.
We didn't have sex.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Like a vampire or some shit?
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Spinning backwards?
The other one?
His wife.
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Good.
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
No.  Have a look.
Where does it lead?
But I...
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Tell me about them...
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
I'm nothing then.
I have to go...
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
I'm...  being...  punished.
That's easy.  You...
Don't worry.
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Great.
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
What about her.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Are you out of your mind?
He's only doing what you told him to.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Choices?
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
Oh my gosh...
Really?   Crazy?
I'm not sure... I might have.
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
In the car?
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
She knows.
Certainly.
Certainly.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
Well...
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Thanks, Duane.
Uh...
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
No.
You weren't in the state legislature.
Where are you going?
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
It's nice.
Fabulous.
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
MARY!
We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
Garden?
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
I couldn't stop myself.
So much the better.
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
No.
What happened?
It's better than doing nothing.
It does?  What?
Stop what?
Chet...
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Knox!  what are you doing here?
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
What is that?
Courtyard?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
AHHHHHH!
A sweaty-toothed madman
Don't stop!
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
I don't.
What?
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Neil, you're not gonna...
Quiet.  I have to think.
what?
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
That's it!  "Follow my voice.  We'll try no manhood here."  See you at dinner.
I don't know.
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
Who asked any?
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Seen a lot of islands?
Yeah you did...
What?
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
No...
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
I don't know...you got what we need?
Joey...
Shut up!
Damn right!
John,we're going huntin'.
They did not!
It's Nick!
Nick...?  Jesus, Nick!
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
I love this car. Some cars sit, you know? This car, a car like this... grows. I mean you never know, with a car like this, where this car has been.
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Sure. Why not.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
I have to go.
Yeah.
You mean...?
Linda, yeah.
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Yeah?
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
Nick, she won't say why.
I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Will you marry me?
I don't know! I don't know either!
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Naw, it's... I mean...
I see you're going hunting.
I... No. You do this for money?
Right here.
Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
There's Vince!
Huh?
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Huh?
Hunt with Vince?
I thought you might be praying.
What do you think?
LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
Here! This is it!
No!!!?
That's it. No. No way.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
Yeah.
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Up.
Down.
Technothugs?
Later.  I want Doucet first.
Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom.
Remember my promise.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
I'm ready.
How then?
Drop it.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Take a look at this.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
Good to know you, Willy.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
No, thank you -- what's your name?
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
All right, darling.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again!
Camomile tea!
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Thanks, Mary.
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
I dunno.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Wouldn't profit him none.
Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
What mountain?
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
Cup for cup!
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
The past six months.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
No, sir.
John.
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
I'm a cop from New York.
I'm going to count to three...
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.  I needed that, John.  I deserved that.
So I've heard.
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
What about the kids?
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
I'm really shakey.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
I'm sorry...
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
I know!
Where you gonna go?
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
You don't have a choice?
Yeah... yeah!
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
I can't talk to him.
What are you doin' in there?
... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it?  Okay?
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
The girl hostages.
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
Come on, lemme load you up...
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
We like you, too.
I want to dictate my will.  I need a notary?
What now, Sonny?
No, not until after they killed him.
Yeah.
You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
My body?  What for?
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Get 'em in the vault!
What?
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
Okay.
All right. 
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go ... but you gotta walk in backwards.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Not now, Mom, please.
Oh.  Run.
Robbing a bank.
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
How much?
What do you think, dumbshit?
I fucked up. You can't help your greedy black lying ass from trying to get everything. All you've done is put a death sentence on Meeka.
You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.

What did he do this time?
And?
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I've done that before.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
That's it?

Fifty cents.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Innocent!
Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
And move to Long Island...
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.

I would like to get paid now.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
Come in then.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?

Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.

Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.

Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
O'clock?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
Me too!
The principal.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Will not.
I will stop this car right now.
Don't look directly at him.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Sure I do. On one condition.
Shut up!
I kinda screwed things up.

Thanks, Pop.
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!

No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
And...?
Wow, you are smart.

I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Basically...

I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
I have no next picture.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
That's good.  I could use the money.
Forget about it.  We'll make our new movie, and you'll be a star again.
So how'd we do?
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Yeah, I did.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Perfect.
Rolling.
What do you mean?
You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Ed, it was only one review.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Like <u>what</u>?!
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
<u>I didn't dump you</u>!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.
Yes.  Hollywood is oh so exciting.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Well, uh, if I could I would...
Wood?  Ward?  Wood.  Hey, what do you know.  It <u>is</u> Wood. Dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  Right?
Raising money is tough.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
Okey-dokey.
Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
No, of COURSE I'm gonna make the movie!  I've already preósold Alabama and Oklahoma.  Those repressed Okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  So we'll just make it without that she-male.  We'll fictitionalize it.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Oh.  My condolences.
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
I don't know.
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
Yeah...?
You're <u>sure</u>???
I'm directing.
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Who?
Where is she? Is she all right?
You know what would be great?
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
Ed --
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us.
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Really? They were..
What?
Right.
Are the TV people with you?
No.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Mom?
Oh God. What hospital?
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Shari, Ray feels --
What is she, at work?
So?
Right.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
That's lucky.
Shari, I really like you...
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
Are you all right?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
No... Could you?
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
What?
I'm doing all right.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
What's the dif --
While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five.
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
I know.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Who's Shari?
I was in jail.
Good?
That's the point -- this could change things.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
What kind of person?
Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
All right.  I'll be back
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Okay, fine. Sure
You bet.
As far as I know, they--
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Hello, Tracy.
Uh-huh.
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
I hope so
What is it. Tammy?
Exactly when?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Still clear?
And she's super-nice
Yeah.
Thanks!
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Don't you fucking knock?
Paul, get out!
Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
Yes.  But do you know?
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
It's Lynn.
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Officer White, put down that weapon and --
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
Which one are you and which one am I?
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
What little studio?
I got her address.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
Say what and so what.
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Gone.  Not a trace.
Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
Something like that.
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
Not even with Exley?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
You sound like you mean it.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
None.  Call it a hunch.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Is she?
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
What's wrong, Trash?
Please hold, Sergeant...
Really?  How?
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone.
Oh Jesus.
Yes.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Someone else?
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Who else have you told?
I'm doing a transfer now.
I'll come straight there.
Why?
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Yeah.
It's a SAT-tracker.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
What'd I tell you?
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
Looks like Detroit.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
What's going on?
Here?
<u>Here</u>?!
Why?
You're driving.
Eight.  Size eight.
For that matter, I think you will too.
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
Witnesses said you were there, but I notice you didn't file a report.
What kind of trouble.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Was he with anyone?
Not that I could see.
You should take this seriously.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
It's okay.
He's got his priorities?
How could you let me find out like this?
I know.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Who?
Don't count on it.
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
Never.
Brill?
How can I be sure.
This conversation's over.
Who <u>are</u> you people?
Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
Fuck you. You may have to--
My shoe?
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
I have to go lingerie shopping.
Who would do that?
I don't under--
What are you talking--
She can't talk to you right now.
Are those my Christmas presents?
No.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
What about jewelry?
Table 122?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Bobby--
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
No. No, it's okay.
How can I reach you?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
I said fuck you.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
Get it.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
Help from whom?  Christ.
He's clever. He had help.
I just meant--
We don't know.
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
No thank you.
Yes sir.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
No, but I think I do.
What do you hate most?
What?  No!
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
You bastard, I was believing you!
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
You will.  You will.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
I know.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
I told you so.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
Okay.
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
No.
You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
Yeah, for a while.
Where've you been?
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
And you've forgotten yours.
What?
Me?
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Off with his head!
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
Are you remembering more?
Could I have a cigarette?
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
Why?  Is he staying?
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
I've been told that before.
You get Hardy.
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
Nya-nya-nya!
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
I'll always go back to that church.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
He's sleeping.
What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
The windows don't open.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
Bingo.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
Yeah. Me.
Which you have in mind.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Too late now.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
Uh. I'm showing off.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Uh, yes.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
That's good. Terrific.
Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
Nice spot.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
One more item--not on the check list.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
Little celebration before we set off.
Duh.
Shut up.
Get the hell in.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
You've thought of everything.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Have really held you under?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
I'm sorry.
The disc is still in there.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
Don't use language with me --
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Who?
All of them.
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Cause of the chromium.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
Out to lunch with the girls.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
What, you think I'm made of money?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute.  We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility.  No, thank you.
It's not about working hard --
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
<u>No</u>.
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Gee, I wonder why.
Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
Uh-huh.
So why would PG&E offer it?
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Did he say why?
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Well.  There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding.  That I kept instead.
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
In the conference --
I'm gonna go live with George.
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
You got more than one?
Ten?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
What do you mean?
Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
No, I wanna say hi.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
I don't do favors for you anymore.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
The boy is our last hope.
And that is why I must go.
Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
Does Luke know?
That should do nicely.
Beautiful.
That's quite a compliment.
It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
Never heard of that system.
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Who's staring?
Has Threepio turned up yet?
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
What have you done to my ship?
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
Why not me?
That they are.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
Only what you take with you.
It is the future you see.
I'll die first.
It won't get through the blockade.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .

A display of primitive apparatus --
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.

With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
All right, so I made another deal.
I got a new deal for you.
You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
So what does this thing do?
A medical team will be standing by.
I'm here.
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
I cannot--
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
What book is that?
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
Well hurry then, and get it.
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
Not you, my husband?
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
And you cannot love me...
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
I?
You didn't ask!
They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
Oh not to bad, kinda like the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story, but other than that it was terrific.
Why don't you let me?
What didn't he tell you?
Didn't who tell me?
Rats?
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
What man?
That's good.
Lies?
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
Where?
Sure did.
Didn't tell you of what she did?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
No.
No, is Regan aware of it?
What do you drink?
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
I don't know, I just thought.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
You just missed them.
Withering Heights.
I'm not Regan.
Intensely.
You and Regan?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
Save your servant
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
And also with you.
The Lord be with you.
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
Always.
Really?
Yeah, a fall.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
I don't know anyone who fits the description.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Come on!
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Bastards! Stop!
Are you a relative?
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you. Do you want him to leave you?
What about tomorrow?
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
What's wrong with them?
No bones.
Two at a time?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
How we doing?
What's the point?
Jack.
Christ, will you look at your hair?
Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
Why the interest?
No, I mean it.
So do I.
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
Terrific.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
What was it like?
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
Okay?
She'll get here.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
Yeah.
All night?
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
No. Why?
What are you talking about?
I told you.  It's a useless talent.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
What?
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
I can keep the beat.
Five years ago.  November.
All right.
Punctuality.  First rule of show business.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
Am I missing something?
Time for what?
A seven.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Save it for your wife.
Right.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
You're a prince.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Virgins.
He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
It's paradise.  That's what it is. Paradise.
No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
Huh?
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Right.  Bring him back.
He doesn't bite.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
He'll come around.
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
I'm not upset.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
He called her.
Long story.
Nervous?
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Yeah.
So how's the cat food business?
Huh?
I've given it up.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
He's got blood in his eye.
How do you know?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Oh?
Yeah?
He's losing his teeth.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
Yeah -- me.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
Shut up.
Let me have a look.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
How come?
Don't hang up ...
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Damn right.
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
Five seconds.
That's your name, isn't it?
Get rid of them.
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
I had doubts too.  I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Great.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
Adelle?
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
I don’t think you’re hearing me.
It’s not good.  Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. We’re not sure which one, Julia’s on it right now. Word is they’re willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company.  The Global people are up in arms.  They say we should’ve been prepared for this.  We’re in trouble here, Jack...
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
Where’s my real dad?
Five thirty.  Okay.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
You’re right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...
She said that?
All I’m saying it there isn’t a guy in Union County who wouldn’t give his left nut to be married to Kate...
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
Yes you do...
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
It’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
Basically, it’s my car now.  Get in.
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
No, I didn’t...that’s great.
Uh huh...
Okay, chief.
For us, Kate.
Yeah...fine.
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
Because you’ll be here.
You’re having a bad day, I’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
That is the general idea, yes...
Really.
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, where’s that chocolate cake...?
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Annie goes to a great school.
Are you okay, Jack?
Not by a long shot.
Do I know you?
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You’re a scotch man, single malt, not because it’s trendy but because you’ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
Is there anything I can do for you?
I've got plenty of places to go.
Yes!
No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
Don't you wander off, boy.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
Gotcha.  Okay.  Supernova bad.
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
Showtime.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Sure.
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!
It's been changed.
Are you kidding?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Reed.  Shh.  Just be quiet.  And look up.
Why didn't you say something?
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Raising the shields.
Medical's ready.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
What're you getting at?
Well, how about hypnosis? That can't hurt him!
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
Brain injury.
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
No question of her loyalty.
Say that again?
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
As part of the Crew.
We must!
Thank you for volunteering.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
No, it requires such absolute precision --
What do you mean?
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
Send the following message...
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Where we going?
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
The only danger of turbulence is in the Heart -- and we're not going through it.  Once in the Carotid Artery, we'll remain in the Arterial System... until we reach the point of damage --  -- where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam. After the operation, we'll return by way of the Venous System --  -- until we reach the base of the neck --  -- where we'll be removed right here -- with a hypodermic.
Was there any damage?
Then don't drift down further.
I'll do what I can.
Is this a fucking joke here?
What's this, sir?
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
I don't know. Few munce.
Whoa, Daddy.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Oh, don't be silly.
Yah.
Mm.
Uh-huh... A what?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
And what about the other fella?
Yah, that can happen.
Uh-huh.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
...Brainerd?
Yah, but -
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Yah, how much money was that?
Well... yah.
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
What's goin' on there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
2:30.
Yah.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah.
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Oh, yah?
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Nope.
Yah?
So... they didn't...
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
They're real good.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
And his wife?
The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
You are?!
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
Sure.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Really?
Please.  Can't we do something... ?
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Really?
Look, this is a bad time...
What... ?
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Please.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Good.
Nothing.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Marla...
Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
Who's this?
Yes... it's a test.
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
Now, find your power animal.
Well, uh... great.
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
What list?
Huh?
Can I stay at your place?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
A nice, big cock.
But a good strange.
What fight?
This fight, pussy.
Shatner.  William Shatner.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Okay.
I thought you did.
Homework assignment.
Hey.
I'm not asking you to.
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
... is over.
What's this all about, Tyler?
Why did you do that?
The house is rented in your name.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
Fuck you.
What?
Defuse the bomb?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
What?
You told me you'd say that.
There is no money.
Let go of me!!
I... I don't know...
No, please, no, God, no!
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long.
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
What list?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
How you doing in there, hero?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
She had the baby?
Random, sure.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
May we come in?
Yeah?
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
Hold on.
You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
I guess so.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
That it's not over yet.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Been on many planes that blew up, have you?
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Huh?
Where's your stuff?
What's that?
I suppose you have...
You comin'?
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
Intelligence work.
Invulnerable.
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
What's the job?
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
He... took it.
Couple hours.  Let me buy you a coffee.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
You still believe in God?
...<u>Forget it</u>... <u>Goodbye</u>!
And who's Lydia?
No, it's not... Come here...
How have you been?
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
No...  He is supposed to live there?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Leave me alone...I wanna go...
I... I was just leaving.
<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
My name is Parry.
<u>What</u>?!
I'm the one what?
Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Parry.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
Fuck you.
You advise us!
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
No, I...
A wig?
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
That's right, hand.
I'm not.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
You'll be gone, period.
"You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know..."
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Sure...
You got any change?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Yeah, well, he's...
My turn.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Yes, intentionally.
Then after that?
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
I gave it a second thought.
Why?
What?
I think it's what you think.
Shut up...
That's what you said?
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
Yeah, I think I could.
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
You're all full of shit!
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Not at all.
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
Don't call me "honey," mack.
There's some good things on it, though.
Perhaps...
If you want to call it that.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
I'm wit' Carlos.
What?
You know somebody around here?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
She lives near Eddie?
For real?
What you want with her anyway'
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
Nothing.
So, then whadda ya want?
Jus' from around the way.
Yeah.
Fletch, this is dumb.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
Can I ask anybody now?
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Margaret.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Just relax.
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
You don't know me.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
That's it?
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
Harry S. Truman?
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Check.
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
You sure did.
No problem.
It’s okay. The cops did it.
Fletch?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Where am I going?
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
How long have they been married?
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
You ordered it here?
Good point.
How come?
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
That's what I want to know.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
In her cabana, sir.
Cabana one.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
This morning.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Who? Donnie and Marie?
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You'll have it.
Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
Not really.
Yeah.
John!
Nuthin'.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
I'll do my best.
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Great pipes.
Right away!
No prob...
Exactly.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Contacts.
I like.
Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
You're not funny.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Wha --
What?
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...
You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
Why have you come to my planet?
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
Forget it.
Who cares?  I got a case.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
'Booty Time.'
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
The case!
Anyway you want it, asshole.
What about Don?
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Are you okay?
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Julian, you're fired.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
What?
Doyle.
It is waiting for you in the garage.
I wasn't looking.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.

Why not?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Pour it in your ear.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Darling, may I have this one?
I been damn careful up to now.
He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
I seem nervous, huh?
Hey, bud.
So am I.
Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
Get him home safe.
Name's John.
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Huh?
I'm not dreaming.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
I don't understand.
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
Something happened, something...
All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Hang on.
Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Go in where?
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Better.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
So how are things at the hospital?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Nah, just working the job.
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
Same thing.
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
Cool it, Andy.
I vote for the hammock.
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
Are you all right, Shelly?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
Sort of.
My whole world.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
Gulp!
I have to.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
We're gonna scare him?!
Better call an ambulance first.
See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
Uh...yes.  But...
Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
Will you listen, dammit!
Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
Look --
I know everything about you, Diana.
It's...It's all right.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
That's what I'd like to know.
Sorry.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Randy, c'mon!
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
Until I hear the truth.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
About Jessica.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
What are you going to do?
Improvise, of course.
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
She didn't push me into coming.
There's something I haven't told you...
After your parents passed away?
What about you?
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Please, hurry...
Big mess every time.
I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
Very bad today.
Press a button and they give us money.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
Do we care?
I'm not ready.
What about the haircut?
Where is it?
That was a big mistake.
What do you mean?
Unbelievable.
You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
We're able to surprise each other.
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Opening night?
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
I'm at the door.
Right here. At the door.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Where's your elastic brace?
I know, Pop.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
Why does it matter?
What about my play?
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
Postpone. We have every right.
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
What?
You know what.
One more time.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
Eleven.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Some of it good, I hope.
Not anymore.  At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or --
Going nearer to God!
What was he like?
No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
We must end the campaign.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
I congratulate them.
Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of "Free India." Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt.
It's for the best.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
I'll see what I can do.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
A man's dead, Detective.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
What a relief.
Again?
You have more in common than you know.
German.
You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
You had to be a right-hander.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
They found my eyelash.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Michael's.
Will you be okay?
How long?
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
Not bad, Jerome.
I'm travelling too.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Antonio, the choir...
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
I'd have to bleach my hair.
You worried about the cost?
I've found him too.
Friend?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
We could go together one day.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
I can't do this.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Get it over with...
I've been there every day for the last four years.
Assumed name... Houston.
Good.
I'm still here, Doc.
It's just been a while.
Really.
You were asleep.
You got the parole, didn't you?
I couldn't have... much longer.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
Bullshit.
I mean it.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
Do it my way.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
And switched keys.
Like what?
El Paso.
Things can't get much worse can they?
I guess we are.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Where?
Chicago.
What about you?
Suit yourself.
What about the vault?
Whatever you need.
How long have you been married?
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
I know. I know.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Well, he drove it into the river.
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Jack, you're wrong.
That's nice.
Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
He's got a new place at Burnham.
You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
What?
Go on.
No.
Was he?
Entertaining.
What kind of entertaining?
You've been watching the film.
Was it Albert?
Shouldn't think so.
No. It's all right.
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Where would I find him?
Large Scotch.
Las Vegas.
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
Get knotted.
It'll cost you.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
No, you won't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Still got your sense of humour.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
That's right, Harry.
Deadbeats all.
I'm not?
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You ever get 'em?
It's too...
You're on this...
...that's right...
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
What hard part?
Just the act.
You build it!
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
What do you mean?
Yes.
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Is that what I said?
He would take you on.  Yes.
I...
No.
Are you sure?
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
That's ridiculous.
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
At home.
No.
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
You...
We had a robbery. 
The leads come in, I'll let...
Just go to lunch.
...did they...
...you didn't close...
All that I'm saying...
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
Let me...
Murray said...
Yes.
What if you don't close...?
Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
The deal still stands, our other thing.
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
No.  It hadn't.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Call up the bank.  I called them.
John: John:...my daughter...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Mmm.
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Uh...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
Twelve-fifteen.
Kenilworth...?
Oh, God...Oh, God...  Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express.  His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.  I have to go.  You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go. 
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
What did I tell you?  What did I say about the three days...?
What are the police doing here...?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
You hear what I said?
When...
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Why not?
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
What is this, your farewell speech?
Have a good trip.
They didn't get my contracts.
Yes.
Yes.
Your contract went out to the bank.
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
Will you take me?
To do business.
I'm not hungry.
What position did you occupy?
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
The children can stay.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
I never met them.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
What's that?
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
He's an Italian?
A pig of a Neaponitan. 
Beautiful.
I'm going to see my parents.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
But if you're wrong...
They can come in now.
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Yeah, that was a good break.  A nice deal.
This committee owes an apology!
Whose orders are these?
Yes, Michael, it does.
It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
On a plane back to Sicily.
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Kay, I told you...
Michael.
You haven't heard me.
Right here.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
Not for a few years.
Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
How is his health?
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
We got friends in the commission.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
Just thinking out loud.
It never crossed your mind?
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
I'm not a kid.
What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
Tea is fine.
A homo?
Well...no, not really --
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
Mornin'.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
I stink to high heaven right now.
What?  Oh yes.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
What did she mean by going flooey?
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
All right, I guess.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
Cut it out!
Oh no.  I never swim.
Something happened to him?
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
You asked me to model.  Remember?
I want -- I want...
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
Can't you see?  It's raining!
We're not sugar.  We won't melt.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
A very lucky thing indeed.
You are much too human.
It's too tight.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Then who did?
You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
What's our pesky friend up to now?
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
No.  But someone you can talk to.
I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow.  Grandfather was a bishop.  Church of...Church of Eng...
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
You're serious.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
Yes ... Kip ...
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
What are you still doing here, Randall?
I don't think so, Detective ...
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
Peugot convertible ...
Gray.
Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
Yeah...
Remember who my brother is?
No.
Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
You guys are through...
We'll take it.
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Sure --
"About what?"
I can see that -
Hey, now -
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
Where'd you find this one?
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
You boost her -- ?
Sure, man --
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
Thought I'd go for a ride -
Where we going -- ?
What are you doing here?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
She was so great, why'd you leave her?
Oh, God...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
What happened to Sway?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Checkin' it out
What? What happened?
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
What?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Nods.
Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
Don't worry about it.
Nah.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
What kind of person doesn't call?
If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Gone.
Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
Oh...
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
You could put a pool in that backyard.
No, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' now, I'm eatin' my snack. WILL  So don't go.
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
History.
How'd you like that course?
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
Building two.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
That's enough.
Hey, how you doin'?
Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
Good to see you.
I've been busy.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
I need someone with your kind of background.
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
I won't talk first.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Oh, that's nice--
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Me too.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
He was my roommate in college.
How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
Like what, Will?
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
When did you know she was the one?
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
I don't know.
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
It's not your fault.
I know.
I'll keep in touch.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Sure.
Yeah.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
Exactly.
Want me to take a look?
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
So, do you play the piano?
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Goodbye.
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
But ain't no reason--
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Gallon or two?
She got to make it.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java.
Sure, but what is this?
Women?
Why, I guess so.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
But--but how we gonna eat?
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
How many of you?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
Sure do.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
Didn' you get no sleep?
You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
They know he got hit in the face.
Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
Are you crazy?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Casy, won't you say a few words?
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones.
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
In the corporate offices.
Yeah...
What?
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
Not much else.
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
That's part of it.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Okay... Hold on...
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
--She's not dead---
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
You know where I live?
I work alone.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
It's only natural....
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
In Portugal, yes.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
It was the PLO.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Wait a minute--
I'm not happy.
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
It's fine.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
That's too bad.
See you in ten years.
Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
To shoot you. Correct.
How did you get this job?
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
Wow.
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
What's that to miss?
You lived in Chicago?
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
Thanks.
OK.
How did you meet her?
What?!
Yeah?
You don't.
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
I didn't see it.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Good.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
The funeral's on Friday.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
I love you.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Well, it's good that you're there.
When are you coming home?
Night.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
You're allergic to hay.
Let's not talk about that now.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
I don't understa-
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
We have a business manager. The best around.
No. He had the choice.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
I'd love to go there one time...
Promise?
Well, of course, right...
I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
I don't think Warren would go for that.
She's an editor.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
I understand...
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
How long were you married?
Where did you learn all this stuff?
Yeah, cool.
It's cool!
The sensitive type.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
What are you doing?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
Name your stakes.
Make it my first born.
Do my ears deceive me?
Okay, thank you.
Uh, hold on...
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
What?
You what?
Alright, let's boot up.
What?
You would have looked better.
Dreams?
Good.
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
You think they're going to bust us?
Virus?
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
What?
Just one moment.
All right.
I don't know Brady.
We're trapped in this house.
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
You guys always look great.
I can see this is useless.
Check him out.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
Double scoops?
Oh Rachel!
Rachel!
Yeah.
Dad, what's going on?
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Got it Ben.
Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Dear God.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink? 
Okay.
What?
Huh?
Sure.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Exploring uncharted territory?
Look where?
Of course.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I wasn't spooked.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
And I can't keep you interested?
Will you call me tomorrow?
Where?
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
Totally.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Sure.
After the movie.
What about the rest of my comic books?
There was no one outside.
I promise.
Okay.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
I'm wasting time.
Are there any special instructions?
We're actresses.
Oh no.  Not at all.
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. 
Yeah.
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? 
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Uh, yes!
Everything's okay? 
No, I don't think so.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Did you ever read this one--?
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
I have been in love with you for so long.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I know it isn't.
Is something wrong?
Lee...
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
I don't know.
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
Oh, honey!
No, thank you.
Yeah.
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
No.
Stop accusing me!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
So you met somebody else?
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Yes, please.
You look so beautiful.
Come on.
Do you miss Frederick?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Yeah?
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Huh?
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
He's fine.
Is there no chance?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Okay.
Uh-oh.
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
Oh, what do they know?
No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Have you?
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
No, you can tell me.
You have.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Oh, yeah?  What?
When'd you get here?
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
I'm going to tell you later....
And?
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Now, whyn't you help us?
And why is it a vacant exercise?
And who is "they?"
...the whole world's out to get you...
That's why my wife adores me.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
Not with any certainty we...
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
Somewhere in Italy.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.

That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Heather? Wha...
What are you doing here?!
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Heather.
That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
No.
But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.

All right, then.
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Your insight is enlightening.
The way you just looked at me...
Skin cancer.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Getting paid for doing shit.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
I said she's been missing for-
Zero's a number right?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
But... I thought...
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
What?
I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
I don't work here.
Hey buddy!
Can you follow them?
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
YOU!
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
WHAT?!
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
He gives a good report and I walk?
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Often, uh.
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
Mister LaPlante...
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
Underbelly!
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
You did save my life!  And it's <u>me</u>! I'd be taking advantage of <u>you</u>! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional...  I...
Bodybuilding!
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
That too.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
What about a reward for coming forward?
She's talking to him now.
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
Dad!
You didn't?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
Let's watch some TV.
Where are these toys of yours?
Right.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
Uh huh.
I'm thirsty.
He'll never appreciate it more.
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Honey --
That's okay, Mom.
Damn.
Honey, are you okay?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
There's no card or anything.
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
C'mon.
That's not the case.
I'm having the floor fixed,
We'll talk in the morning.
It's fun.
What did the thermometer say?
The thermometer's broken.
Get on the other side of that.
Even cosier.
Uh huh.
They appear to be authentic.
Yes.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
Living.  Remember?
Then she should be an excellent dancer.
So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
The past?
Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
Paul.  I thought we agreed.  No press.
In the highlands?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
I'm interested in mythology.
Yes -- it is.
I've seen it.
Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
We'll see.
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
I don't know.
My dreams died long ago.
Yes, sir.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
I understand.
You think we should take that chance?
You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
Like what?
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
Where is it?
If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
Holster your guns!
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Where's the office?
We're okay.
I think so.
Yes, sir.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Excuse me?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Canadian Club?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
Will you protect us.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Whiskey?
You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
You think they will believe you?
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
) You cannot kill them all.
Take the river road back. It is clear.
Oh my God!
Just drive, Gregoire.
Of course.
Your brother's here?
I couldn't help.
But who is left?
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
You cannot go alone.
I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
Yes.
It was substantial.
A car.
I want to know.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
What sort of plan?
What! Paul storms off.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
I'm confused.
And what's Steven's status?
So what stopped her?
It's complicated. But don't worry --
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Not at all!
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
Oh dear.
More to the point. Where's our host?
Yeah...something.
C'mon.
Ms. Marr!
You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Over here!
Prove it how?
This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
Why not?
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
That's crazy!
For chrissake give me a hand!
I hope not.
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Asking the wrong person again.
-- I pose you the same question --
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- what...are...you...going...to --
And here's your goddamn severance!
Maybe if I --
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
How, he's supposed to be dead!
For the love of God....please...?
You say you saw some activity here?
Suppose not.
I don't understand.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Where is she now?
Well, that all depends.
What?
I don't know.  That's strange.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
What about the other five percent?
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
What!
Oh.
Runic?
Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
So where is it?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
Right.  Right!
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
And he still sits there?
That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
Sure.  Why?
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Yes. 53
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated.
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
"Attempted."  At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I....
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
You're supposed to be dead!
Yeah.  The big E.
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
I was the Warden?
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals.
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
But you're going to tell us anyway...
I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Tell me about it...
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
That smart?!
Well, maybe I --
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Please! Norville!
Well, I --
...I'm sorry.
What a beautiful thought.
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Sure, Norville, sure...
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Sez who?
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Terrific.
For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
Nah, that's all forgotten.
But, Buzz, you know I never --
Yes sir...
Geez, I --
Yessir.
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Well, I made the dean's list.
Hmmm.
Not even behind your back?
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
I'm afraid so.
Ti-Joseph?
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
Is this disease common in the tropics?
That's rather nice, isn't it?
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Of course not!
I'm sorry...
I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.  I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother.
I told you.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Um, yes.
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
What do you mean?
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
Damn it, Ben --
I'm fine dad.
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
In a bit.
What?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
-- What advice? You never --
-- 73
But what?
Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Sure. Maybe coffee.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
Oh Wendy.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
Social work?
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
All will be revealed, baby.
Just be careful.
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Thanks for the advice dad.
How do you know this shit?
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Then why'd you come after me?
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
Yeah.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Her name's Libbets.
What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
I have plans.
What are you doing?
One more shot?
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
Do it again.
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
Twelve years younger.
Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here.
I told her to come.
How do you mean?
He's asking everybody questions.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
You know I remember that.
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
Stuff.
What kind of stuff?
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
My arm!
What was it?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
He.  Well, he...
There's nothing more to talk about.
This an accident, Walter?
If you want it to be...
Who made us what we are?
Listen to me.
Then blame the one who made her...
That's what the one who made me said.
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
But how will I ever know, Louis?
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
It's only mortal death.
Give it to me!!!
How do you mean, start?
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
The crucifix -
Read her thoughts.
You finish her - if you feel so much -
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
CLAUDIA!!!
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
And they frighten you?
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
I'm a vampire.
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
You loved your wife, surely.
Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
Yes...
What are you doing in my closet?
Yet. Nothing yet.
No means yes.
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
It's too late for that.
What do we do?
Come on, you can make it.
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
It's gonna be great.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
What do you mean, Julie?
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Wanna drink?
He leave you?
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
How's the water?
You don't have to be a jerk.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
My friend -- what can one say --
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
I think not.
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
She has never mentioned her family.
I was looking for you.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
The General — you don't even know him.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
It was, the plague
We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
What is her illness?
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
No, of course not.
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Oh, wonderful!
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
The Building and what?
I know that girl!
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
When'd you see him last?
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Give the flower a drink.
Uh-huh.
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
Came back three days ago.
Hmmmm . . .
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
What's that?
It's important.
George . . .
The whole town's gone crazy.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
Well, I don't.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
You may kiss my hand.
That does it –– come here.
Thanks for dropping around.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
I don't care. It's George's tux.
Oh, Mom –– I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
I think we're changing course a little.
Back down!
I hope that's the cousin.
Sean!  Catch it!
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Want to talk about it?
Can you get us a line?
No!  It's still there!
I need a hand here....
Happy to do it.
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
You got it.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
Oh, c'mon.
You want to come here a minute?
Pop.  I'm sorry.
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
We don't know that, do we?
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
That's it.
What makes you think there might be?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
Late.
So's a donut.
Careful.  What's wrong?
Nothing.
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
I'll give notice.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
You going to fool around with Mike?  Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
Shh.  Shhh....
Nope.
That's a crock of shit.
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
I'm not sure I can.
What about me?
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Maybe.
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Go on, you're tired.
Yeah.  Down there.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Oh, yeah.  Very.
I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
Yes?
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
Sure.  Let's go.
It's too soon to move him.
Well, that's why you got it.
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
Michael, you're not going down there.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I can have them walk backwards.
I'm sorry.
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
Why?
Still sleeping.
Why are you?
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
And here I thought I was charming you.
Get ready to go.
Brian, he's coming around!
She, Mister Hutton.
I don't know, it depends.
You like Florida?
Depends on big brother.
Why you sonuvabitch...
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
I don't know, what else is there?
Come on, it's fun!
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Take it up.
What're you doing later?
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Polar bears in Georgia???
The world's southern most reaches.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
It's not closing, Mike.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
That's Dad...
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Because....
Spent it all on beer....
I'm not doing anything.
What's going on?
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
I'm just getting started....
Dad died from a heart attack....
I am.
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
The plane's turning....
Nothing....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
Just like that?
You got a better idea...?
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Inch by inch....
I stuck them on, man....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
Money is money....
Okay...we got it together....
How long have you known Hoagie?
Who?
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
Maybe the gear crapped out....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Screw you, Jake....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
The van?
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
I hope I'm not intruding?
Be my guest. What you got?
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
It's a method for quitting smoking.
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
I haven't got it.
Just makes to so God damned mad ..
<u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?"
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
I've heard you call him Freddy.
Why not? You heard my voice?
No.
No.
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
Pray?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
He said that? What else did he say?
You know? How do you know?
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
He don't know that. I didn't.
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
Whass going on here?
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Well, no you didn't --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Hello?
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
-- especially one like this.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Good evening.
Happy. He said "happy?"
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Let's not tell our sad stories.
Same to you.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
Thank you.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
No--
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Let's do it again.
Call me tomorrow.
I might call you later!
Another drink please.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
No.
Beautiful.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Go.  Flee.
What --
To the pools?
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
Dick.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
Yeah I know.  I did.
Funny.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
What did you say!
Just drop it Paul!
When did you have it last?
Think.
Dr. Grant was.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
KEEP GOING!
Really?  What do you do there?
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Goodbye, Alan.
On the island.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
Mine's new.
But then you never get to go in space.
This plane can not land!
But you never came across just one.
It doesn't matter what I think.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
So what?
How close do you have to be?
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
Possible.
Why?
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
What do you think they want?!
What are they?
I don't know.
DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
But why?
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
No.
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
'Bout thirty seconds.
They are?  I'll be damned.
You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
They smell.
Anything else, you old fossil?
It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
What kind of park is it?
We were right!
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
Yes it is.
No.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
The kids okay?
For today, I guarantee it.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Let's get outta here!
What does he mean by "target audience"?
I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
Thanks, Dad.
They don't bother me.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
That was great!
I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
Yeah?
I think we're lost.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Help me with this.
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
That's my job.
What?
Who?
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
So?
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk, too.
Add it to the list.
Not yet.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
And if he's not?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
It's my last and final one.
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
When I have no reason to doubt.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
-- Listen to me --
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
It's ... lovely.
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
I'd just be guessing.
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
Didn't want you.
No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
Yes.
Will you let me go then?
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Honest?
Mm.
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
-- Tuscarora --
Most of them.
What're you gonna do next?
Goodbye.
You and I -- a relationship.
With Trina.
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
About what?
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
Well as a matter of --
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Just send me a money order.
She told me.
Then how are you involved?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
Yes?
Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Welcome to the... 
Oh, Christ...Ah, yeah...you want to know why mom's not here, right?
Sure.  Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...  ... eggs!  Right?
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
You're no bargain either, pal.
Yeah?
Good night.
Sleep tight.
See you in the morning light.
Dad?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Uh huh...
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Where will my toys be?
Who will read me my stories?
Overruled.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
I...I don't know...
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
Yes.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
Yes...How's Billy?
You want what?!
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
Listen, Ted...I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
I know....I know.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Do you want the kid or don't you?
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
I walk in the house and before I can say "How are you?", "Did you have a nice day?" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door.
I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?
All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
You're sure?
Slow down...Slow down...
No.  I don't think so.
I don't mean a little favor. mean a big F favor.
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
Uh, huh...
Ha!  You tell me.
Where are you from?
Can I do anything I want?
Are you? Of whom?
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Yes, but they say he did.
I miss my brother.
How many?
Two.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
Do you have money?
No. This war is almost over.
I do not know, Holiness.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
You decide.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
You, kill me?
Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
Hmm.
You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
Go ahead.
I need to see his habitat.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
Keystone what?
Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!
And you like me.
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
We're ready.
That hurt my feelings.
Oh, bullshit.
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
What?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
You flew up here because your boss--
Good.  See ya soon.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
I didn't say it like that.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Alright, Jack!
You wanna ride in my truck?
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
They look like they're jumping.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
Other than to eat us?
Where is he?!
Did he say anything?
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
Sheriff.
What is this?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
That it's about to go wrong.
Me too.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
<u>Kelly</u>--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Kelly--
But why? He didn't weight the others.
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
You're all right! Where is he?
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
That wasn't me.
Yes sir.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
What would it take?
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Let's get some coffee and talk.
Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
Did you ever work with her?
She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.
I am, yes.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
By the book, he's a sadist.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
Horses - and sheep...
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
But you could. You did.
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Absolutely.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Your "father"?
Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
He did?
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
What?!
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
What would you have me do?
Maybe...
I sent three men to Webb!
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Aversion?  No... "Hatred"... "Loathing"...
"Some"?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
: Only one or two loads.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
You're not coming with us?
And what is that?
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Yes.
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
This interview's over! The militia stays!
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
France.
La victoire.
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
Yeah...right...
Was there such a thing?
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
No!
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
All right...
Ahhhh!
And it killed Bo?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
I signed-up for the stock option.
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
Twelve hours!
Like a leech.
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
I ought to smack your face!
Oh man, that's just great...
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Right.
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
Well, talk.
It's hit us all hard!
I'll think of something, don't worry.
Apart from those shotguns.
Like antiques.
You should see what they did to poor Gary.
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
Nope.
All right, Dad.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
OK, open the gate.
And the weed?
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
Right as rain.
A hundred grand.
I like your bar.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Six.
How many feet?
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
What do you mean?
That makes it okay?
I can fix cars.
If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
And what did she do?
I am, sir.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Chaos.
Yes, sir.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
A .45--
So is Buddy on your short list?
You little pissant--
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
My mother said he never asked about--
Go out through the back.
I got a pretty good guess.
Well--
I have a B average.
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
It's a lead mine.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
You going to get married?
Mikey look at this--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
Right.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
This girl has a child?
That's a matter of interpretation--
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
--Santiago.
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
I haven't been out here for a while.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
And Buddy was one of them.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Well, you hire illegals--
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
Okay? He's not here?
I'll see what's going on.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
Weird what you remember.
He hates me.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Pilar--
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
Like your story is over.
Yeah?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
Couple months before I was born--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Gotta be in person.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
And people better clear out of here! Now!
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
But you don't see much competition, do you?
Me neither.
Yeah.  It's French.
It'll be something hokey.
Right.
Deep shit?
About?
I don't know.
Why did you wait so long?
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
What is he?
Maybe he'll show you.
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
And are you afraid?
Did your husband know Quaid?
I think we make our own futures.
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
Do you?
Sure.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
That's my business. Harry.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
Out!  Out!
Oh God.
He got up and walked.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Then what do you want?
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
Harry D'Amour.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
I did it for Dorothea.
Is that all?
Can you do it?
A couple of weeks.
Fuck you.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
How long have you been married?
Philosophy.
I'm here for the week.
OK, see you downstairs.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Ok, whatever you want.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Oh.
Do you know where we are?
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Ok, bye.
Yes?
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
You know, eat healthier.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Hello?
Ok.
Bye.
Great.
What?
Good...I'm tired.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
Promoting that action movie I did...
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Uh...sure...I...what?
Hmmm.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I can't believe Will killed him.
Yeah, like...
I found the pentacle.
Peter, are you okay?
And how would you describe him?
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
But bad judgement.  And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
Yes.  We won, that's right.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Peter...Peter Kelson.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
What?!?!
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
So what?
Then why are you here?
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
You watch.  One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes.  I'll have more money than God.
Of course.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
What happened?
Where is she now?
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
Engaged.
Maybe she is.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
No I don't.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
That's not it.
Are you okay?
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
Thanks.
Oh, sorry.
Uh-huh.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
Yes, we appreciate that.
No.
Yeah, right.
They ever love you back?
I know.  But chances are...
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
I was just playing ball.
I wouldn't know.
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Please.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
You having fun?
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
I know, right?
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
Quincy...
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
The "man" again.
Cheap date.
Least she had time for me.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
What are the doctors saying?
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
Figured it was something like that.
No.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
Why do you keep asking me that?
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
And what happens when you lose?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Later when?
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
I mean, it's not true, is it?
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
We need to talk.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....
No.  No.
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
I'm coming!
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Did you hear what I said?
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
No.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
No.
No.
ok.
That's great, thank you.
It's not -- what's a 422?
You won't.  You won't have to.
Thank you.
If you're not here for a 422 --
Just Jim.
Good bye.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
So you've done it --
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
Yeah.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
That was so great what you just said.
please, what is it, please --
It doesn't matter.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
No.
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.
I have love.
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
Braces.
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
You do?
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
...cocksucker....
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something.....  Gimme a cigarettee?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
This isn't meant --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
Around here.
people die.
Not a problem.
In five years?
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Kind of.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
I am calm.
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
I don't have to answer your questions.
I'm not askin', Marcie.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
I got in trouble at school.
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
Slowly or quickly?
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
No.
Just once.
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
No.
I don't know what I've done.
I'm Bob.
Like what?
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
I have to go.
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
Phone number.
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
I didn't know the answer --
I said I'm fine.
hang in there, ok. I love you.
Go to bed.
It's ok.
It's not right.
I have money to give you.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
M'lady...?
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
I am preparing for a ball!
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
No, Louis!  No!
A body.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
Three days.
About to hang himself, I should think.
What you're asking is impossible!
But --
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Forgiveness?
It is also a place of burial.
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Raoul --
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
A personal nature?
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
At least help Raoul.
They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
Exactly why it should be given away.
Sire, I --
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!
Great. Well that changes a lot...
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Did you start out area six?
Gotta come from somewhere...
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
Who is it?
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Where up north?
Figure you would have tried it already.
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
OK...where do you want to start?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Hop in.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
That's when it happened?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
Library of Congress.
Read it.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
Somebody hurt him?
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
We will feel sick for a very long time.
Wait, Will...
Get me a plane!
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
There has to be.
It's not over yet.
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
What's being photographed?
When do you need it?
Tonic will be fine.
They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
Francis? Where are you?
Yes.
No.
I'm very scared.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
I don't know...
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
You will tell the truth?
No.
When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Hi, Linda. ..
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
No. I can help you.
That's true.
He only bit women so far, right?
What would you call him?
What did he want?
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
You haven't smoked in two years.
Will...
They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...
You got a deal...
You going back down to Florida after?
Go on to the house.
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
Yes.
How?
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
Why should I tell you?
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
No.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
Yes. I'd considered it.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
May I keep the file?
Fight what?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Let's walk the route.
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
You've got good days and bad days.
Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Okay.  You're probably right.
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
GET OFF!
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
Don't believe everything you hear.
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
It's Choi.
I know.  It's her fault.
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
You killed them.
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
No!
Midnight watch.
Cypher?
I got you.
Are they any agent?
Stand up and see for yourself.
Right now?
Go the the Adams Street bridge.
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
Do you want to know what it is?
What truth?
This can't be...
Far from it.
You've never used them before.
Because... I didn't think I would?
And she knows what?  Everything?
And you still believe I'm the One?
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
Good.
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
But an Oracle can.
I don't know.  It just went dead.
There has to be something that we can do.
What?
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
Because...
Do what?
Not yet.
Zion?
Where is it?
They're hacking his mind.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
Neo, this has to be done!
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
Why?
He's alive.
I'll be all right.
I can't!
I don't know.  I lost him.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
That means it's good.
I gotta get the stuff.
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
She don't look Jewish.
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
So?
I'll say that I'm travelling.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
We'll settle it tonight.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
How much?
Let's go to the movies...on you.
Charlie, this is business.
You said it.
I know.
That's nice.
Bye.
Well...
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
 Shut up.
Yeah, I think so.
You what?
Can you spare it?
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
I know you do, darling.
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Who's Annie?
He said he would be there with bells on.
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
Hello, Quince.
Here...
Of whom?
Then why did you bring it up?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
Olympic.
As much as Joe's?
Sure.
Don't you want to hear the details?
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
You get not to go to jail.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
But I didn't mean to do it!
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
I from dat nex' place.
No, no.  I on holiday.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Mine, too.
She knows how she feel.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Good morning, Jennifer.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
What do you mean 'free'?
I am Joe.
Peanut butter.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
I've got plenty of friends.
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
Watch me do what?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Not now.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
Girlfriend?
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
More than you love peanut butter?
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
I love you in an evening gown.
It's a saying.
I believe that, don't you?
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
No.
No.
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
Yes?
Not this.
Oh.  Okay.
What's okay?
Then I can't help you.
Not at all.
You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
And we're very grateful.
That's life.  What can I tell you?
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
It's enough now.
What do you mean?!
I'm here.
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
I'm doing great.  You ready?
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
Yeah.  I guess so.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
It's something.
The fireworks are about to start.
I'm sorry --
So you're a one-girl guy?
I could be her.
Y'didn't?
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
That's it?
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
That's the thing. I have this condition.
What's it like?
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
Thanks.
Where'd you get it?
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
You did explain, Lenny.
So you have information for me?
I wasn't helping you for money.
Sorry.
Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
So I just take your word?
There are things you know for sure.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
And? 
Why would you do that?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Help me.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
Shut the fuck up!
Sweet.
How do you know about me?
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
Fucking hope not.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
Why are you following me?
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
I never said he was faking! I never said that!

You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?
He any good?
You can't.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Yes you do...
I got the item.
I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
I insist.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
Available cash is not an issue for us...
Maybe I'm only one.
Hola, viejo.
What's the best fortune you ever got?
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Alonzo...
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
Like...?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
Verdado where?
Oh, that makes it okay, then.
I am asking.  You to me.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
If you're down, we're down for the play.
Detective Crockett.
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
Never heard of him.
Have faith.
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Goodbye.
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
What would you do...?
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Men, they mostly faggots.
Yeah, oh yeah.
What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
For money.
I mean, dammit, where you live?
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
Yeah, well, so?
Don't say nothing about you either.
Yeah.
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
What you got me up here for?
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Ready for hard work, son?
Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
Instant V-goddam-D.
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
No. You got it.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Don't make me laugh.
Ziat!
Stop shitting me, man!
Everything.
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
Lucky girl.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
It's not fair!
That doesn't seem so bad.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Jimmy?
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
It's already been cut.
You know where it is?
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
You're ayip!
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
What's your name?
Jeremy...
Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Yeah...?
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
You know what I mean...
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
No such thing, baby.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Toss the flare down!
That's camouflage...
Peter-
Your arm, you can't...
Talk to me.
Just like Trump Tower, then.
I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
I'm not much of a critic.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
No, what is it?
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
The profanity bothers you?
It has no nobility.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
No big deal.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
--cliff-hangers--
But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any "experimental blood transfusion" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there.
Have to wait.
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
A toast?
Well, it certainly says you.
Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
It's perfect.
Paul, this will be our legacy.
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
Oh, I like that tone.
What thing?
What is it?
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Marcia, please.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
All done, chief..
Where is it?
Well that depends.
Magic...
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
A change of plans?
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
I knew where it was.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself.  So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts.
Then we got'em!
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
Oh, either way works for me.
- right..
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Of what?
I'd like a little more conviction..
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Much.
Then feel better!..
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Just about..
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Have you met them?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
You mean it'll be difficult.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
..not in time to save him.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
What about him...?
Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
May take a little time.
Krieger.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
What?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Sure...
You didn't have to.........
Okay...
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know
Are you damaged?
Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
No sir.
Why was there another team?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Very good.
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
Let's move!
Bank?
Where exactly is it?
Always.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Jim we canít.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
- and picked us up in the States -
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
Whatís going to make him do that?
They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
Why don't you take a look?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
And a lonely ass.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Why you drinking so much?
You're welcome.
Yes.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
The guy died.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
He did?
Yeah.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
That's it.
Where'd Johnny find you?
No.
How many men since then?
Stupid yourself.
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
I'm a wolf?
A bride without a head!
Where are you taking me?
That light.
What did I do?
I can't do that!
Thank you.
I was.
Is Johnny here?
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Right.
Yeah, I'll be in.
You? No.
Bobo, take the cart away.
Then let's set the date.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
Pop.
Pop don't like Johnny.
A wife knows.
No. Are you drunk?
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Did you see it?
No.
What sins have you to confess?
I know.
My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
Did you see the moon last night?
Come on in.
My mother's recovered.
You're kidding?
That's incredible.
Have you come to make peace with me?
It was a miracle!
But absolutely!
Will you join me for dinner?
What do you do?
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
You were a tiger last night.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Oh. Right.
I knew she had it.
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
What?  Ridden on a horse?
You're using coconuts!
Am I right?
The Britons.
Well, who is your lord?
A what?
One that looks nice.
Yes ...
Now - go!
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
Then you shall die.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
There are some who call me Tim?
It is the rabbit.
I'm thirty-seven.
What?
Shut up!
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Bloody peasant! 
When's your next round?
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
Rather what?
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
Just you ...
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
You got my note!
He's come to rescue me, father.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
She'll be worried about me.
She'll get over it.
I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Yeah.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Mama...
I'm sorry?
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
If you hunt, you kill.
Quite.
Surely --
Was there never ambition?
Why?
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
Aye.
No other aspiration?
Why do you think I keep her here?
Too busy looking after themselves.
In time, she will.
Archie.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
We'll see which way the wind blows.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
What's her excuse this time?
No, she wasn't.
Yes.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Cold is good!
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
Unwell?
I understand he was in a fight.
I have no idea.
I have a letter, ma'am.
Ma'am.
Why is he not here?
What's the question mark?
Maybe he's not dead.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
What?!
We can't...
I was afraid you'd say that.
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
We're actually inside, aren't we?
You've got the schematics, check.
Right, then...
Hold my keys, then.
Wait!  No!  That's not it!
You have no time.  What is your question?
You have no time.
Not yet, honey...
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
Give her a chance, will you?
I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
What do you mean "you know"?
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
There is no problem.
So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
I understand.
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Wow!
I was afraid of that.
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
Yes.
Very pleased to meet you.
Yes, there was.
Can you tell me what happened?
Diane?
Number 17.
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
"So... surprise"...
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
No, we don't.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Thank you... thank you very much.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
Oh boy.
The one of 'em still alive?
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
Leave him, he's dead.
Why should I ?
I don't know.
We have to climb up that.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
I'm not listening.
Not listening !
I'm listening.
At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
He hired you to build this place ?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
I work here, remember ?
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Just shut the fuck up.
I told him not to sit down in there.....
Why ?
Where ?
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
We will start work on it now sir.
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
And how much do we pay you annually ?
Sir ?
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Better, sir.
Not you Zach.  Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs, dear.  Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ? Is it the grandest of all the Park's tapes ?
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
We can't.
We can't afford too many surprises.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
I think I'll see hat action.
Excuse me, gentlemen
Do you want to go out with me ?
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Come to the rescue again I see.
Well, I think if you take several lines out of context, Star Wars becomes a very sexual movie. I mean listen to this.  "Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ?" or "You came in that thing ? You're braver than I thought".
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Are you writing a poem?
Oh, just put it over there.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
You want me to move?
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Well you know what I mean.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Seriously.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
You're being narrow-minded.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
I told you it was a long story.
That's okay.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
Happy hunting.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
My mother.
You're so clever.
MOM!
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Get married?
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Nick?
This has been a real confusing day.

Wow!
I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
She'll be all right baby.
Sort of?
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
It would be fantastic.
Hey! Oh look.
You have no idea.
Do you know him?
Vada!!
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
I'm impressed.
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
I wrote that.
Okay.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
Are you mad at me?
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle..... 
Is it for a child?
Any more soda left?
I love this guy! 
Dad??
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
He was allergic to bees.
Oh come on.
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Thank you. Bye.
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Please.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
No.
Really?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Chocolate?
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
I would.
No, I'm divorced.
Come here, sit down.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Aarrggh.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Yes!!
I don't want, I don't need your help....
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
Uh huh.
Hurry!
What's wrong with your eyes?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Duck!
What?
What do you want it for anyway?
For their meat.
I am running faster!!
Hurry!!!
I wanna live with them too.
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
Then go home, baby.
Okay, seeya.
Like they do on TV?
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
Kindred spirits.
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
You've been working on this, huh?
Ben Gay.
Let me rephrase that...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
You win.
He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
... whatever is manly and independent.
He won't get mad, huh?
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
That's my point!!
... maybe it's congratulations.
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
Lower.
Lower.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
To him.
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Is there food?
You'll have to speak up.
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
He knows better.
His Word.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
Who the hell is he?
He's going to run for president.
That's what he wants.
Whose?
Minimum.
Okay.
Where the hell have you been?
It's the den mother.
She sure sings nice.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
How do you know?
I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music --except for you. You're into politics.
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
No.
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Do you carry door handles?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Does their hair fall out?
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Bye.
When I was little, in church.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Yes. Who's this?
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Older.
Older than thirty?
Oh.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Glad to meet you.
He's pretty well known down here.
Yes.
Might be good for you.
Sleeping.
I mean...
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
I'm Opal.
I know a couple.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
You bet.
What did you think then?
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
Susanville, Soledade.
You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!
Wagons, hooaaa!
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Yours.
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
How 'bout Manson?
She sings? What does she sing?
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Then was it worth it?
Tell me about the purity.
When have they ever been right?
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
No.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
Survival of the fittest.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Jesus...
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Thanks.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
I can't do that. Five guys.
Three.
And me.
Yeah.
No thanks.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
What d'you say, Duff?
Hell, you got steady work.
Don't start no trouble, boy!
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Where's Wilma?
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
Okay.
Where's he at?
Guess I don't.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Have anything in mind?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Don't Duff--
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
No, on the porch.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Just for the day?
No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
That's right.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Hmmm - good coffee.
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
About ten dollars.
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
What's so hot 'round town?
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
What 'you signifyin'?
Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Beat it!
Okay.
I said, she's in great shape.
Okay.
All right, son.
Guess it's never been easy.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
I understand.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Right here.
Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
I'm fine.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Dixie McCoy
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
The access code to your mainframe.
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
Nobody has.
How are we doing?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
How's the ice break?
You haven't got it?
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
I had to limit your options.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Shhh...
I don't sleep much. You packed?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
YOU KNIT?
You're Pam?
If you say so.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Bridgework?
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Just get in the van, Josie.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
You've done five of my ideas.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
But I don't want it straightened out.
Oh. Right.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Are you in special ed?
Dude, you rock!
You said that already.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
I know.
No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
Sorry. Forgetful.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Thank you.
I'm thinking when I'm home.
No, I'm alone.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
Yeah, I have.
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
What?
That's what I'm saying.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Why not?
He stayed a long time.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
Don't be a smart ass.
No.  Upstairs.
You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
Where's Jesse?
He's dead, you bitch.
What about it?
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Yeah?
Traumas of a ten-year old.
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
I don't know - a sharp pain.
You want to talk about it?
Eggs?
Sure...go ahead.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
Did she always have nightmares?
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
I thought I'd wait for you.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Can't it wait till morning?
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Research.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
To old friends.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
It's an amazing gift.
Sure.
He's heavy in the halls...
He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
Can't be good news coming from you.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
So?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
A little basic, but nice.
I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
Thank you.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
Call me Nancy.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
With Hypnocyl?
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
And what are they?
How do we get in?
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
I won't allow it.
Me too.
I'm a vegetarian.
Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
Bye.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
I was.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
Why?
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
What do you think?
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Don't ask.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
Well... how have you been?
Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
Thank you.  Shall I...
The truth is...
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
Well, thanks, that's great.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Right.
Well, fire away.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Who?  Someone famous?
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
No, it doesn't.
She's perfect, perfect.
That's not fair.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Does she know you're coming?
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
What?
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
Just take my work for it.
Yes.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
And yet you suspect her.
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Y-y-y-yes...
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
No, it was irresponsible!
Welcome back.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
So long, kid.
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Yeah...
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Hey, what's that?
I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
Lobotomy!
A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
Sure, Mack...
I'm not running a charity ward...
What's he talkin' about?
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
What is it?
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
All right!
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Yeah!
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
'Kay...
You's better believe it, brother!
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
What?
After you, ma'am.
Asshole.
Why, sure, ma'am...
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
He's dead.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Si.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
So.  How do we get to Rome?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Seriously.
--separate, in the evening..."
Yes.  We did.
What is it?
Exactly.
What great aunt?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
You are leaving, aren't you?
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Right now?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
NO.
What are you doing here?
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
There is no us.
Uh huh.
Just since yesterday.
I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Really?
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
I have vacation time coming to me.
My God, you have...
You're coming with me?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Are you sure?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Sorry.
'Course he does.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Good luck.
You sure you'll be okay?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Uh huh.
Oh.
Kate.
A porco?
Giovanni.
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Ten billion to one.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
Why should he forget it?
I'm not thirsty.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Yeah— yeah— I guess I do— but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready— remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens— This bum Wilson he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark! – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
Tommy, what happened?
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
I can get home all right from here—
How would you've done it?
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
What?
What for?
I don't know.
Oh she's a beauty.
In a saloon?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Well, it's over.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Someone else c'n take your confession.
What are you going to do?
About Edie?
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
What do you want from me, Father.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You go to hell.
D 'n D?
Nice fellows.
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
You was a Golden Warrior.
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
Forty-five bills.
Gimme.
By way of Chicago?
Nothing happened, Johnny.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
One of these days.
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Nolan... .
If I could get my hands on you...
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
Something's making that music.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
Can't we get out of here?
Yes I feel it in my bones.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
What can we do against them?
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
A situation easily remedied.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
I will decide the conclusion.
Then cancel my order.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Then why do you shake so?
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
He'd call every once in a while.
Thank you.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
She's coming with us.
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
Oh, man.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
You at least bring the gun?
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Two hours.
What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
You know how I felt about her.
Whatta you wanna do?
Half for doing what?
And who watches your back?
They sure do.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Sure, Daniel.
You don't, huh?
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Who?
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
So you've done this before, huh?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
Why, are you famous?
How many was that?
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
You have to be kidding.
Yeah...
Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
A girl.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
To warn her about Chino.
I don't know.
You know.
You know what I mean.
I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
Looks like tonight.
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
It works.  You should try it sometime.
What's to think about?
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
That time?
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
Glenn, take the exit.
Why's that?
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Me?
Right now, son.
Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
Flyweight.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You not with probation, one of those?
He's still married though, huh?
Oh, he's moved out?
Then they're not separated, are they?
I really gotta go.
"Hey, yourself."
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Ten gees.
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
Nervous?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Home of the brave!
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
Yeah.
Then why are you looking for her?
Waitress!  Four beers!
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
Fuck you.
I'm out of fuel!
We've always tried to beat each other.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Our doctor's gone too.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
Have the planes made it to China?
I'm not telling.
I've been trying to drag it out of her for years.  You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
I can't. It's all too much.
Were taking you back to the nurse.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
That loud—mouthed little bitch~
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eighty—six.
And nothing will ever change that.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Charlie. About last nights..
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
It opens, too. Look inside.
I thought you were...for a while.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Test?
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
I beg your pardon?
He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
What a treat.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
I think I'm way ahead of them.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
The hat business is in trouble.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
The house payments.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
I	know what a burrito is.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
You look pretty good for a corpse.
There's one way to find out.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Give me some credit, will you?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Sixty—forty.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
What are you doing?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
What will they be made of?
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
You alright?
All set.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
The old Indian burial ground.
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Allright. Calm down.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
A reaction to AZT...
You're not smiling.
Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
We?
They didn't fire her?
You're right.
Uh huh...
Do you... pray?
There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
I've considered that.
Except... you were gay?
I'm an excellent lawyer.
If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
Yes.
A good start.
Something like that.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
No. I can't really see it.
I'm fine.
Where's Dad?
What did you say?
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Why are we going to do that?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
... we've got a committee meeting.
What kind of people?
People who want to bend the rules...
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
You had one guy "like that?"
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
<u>What</u>?
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
As fast as you can.
I can't....I can't....
Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?
Let's just be sure.
Well, don't ask me to.
Thought you didn't believe his story.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Thanks for the tip, Johns.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
How much?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
Frightening thought.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
Do you have any weapons?
You still don't believe me, do you?
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Good luck then.
Remembers what?
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
Where did you learn to do this?
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
You didn't think so then.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
No.
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
By our time.  You've turned gray.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Climb off me, will you!
Why special?
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
You want her that much?
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Yeah, what is it?
Shaddup bitch.
Over here!
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Here have some of this. Won't feel a thing.
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
No thanks?
I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
How long would that take?
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
I see.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
Do you think I don't?
He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
No thank you.
Nice of him.
That's all there is.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
I didn't notice him.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
No use waiting, then.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Ale. I don't mind.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.
There isn't anything you can do.
I don't want to talk.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
I can't answer that.
But even if you were in love with me.
Morning. Any calls?
Why not here?
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
That comedian?
Who told you my name?
I don't.
Well--good night.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
What?
Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
What do you want?
You nasty, sardonic--
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
Let me know when you've identified him
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
We don't need him.
Go live in a tent.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
You get it's brother.
So it seems Sergeant.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
The card says so, doesn't it?
I do.
I have a rough idea.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
I told you she's just..
What a shame.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Yes.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Yes.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
I see.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
And some of that.  Sorry.
Yes, please.
Thank you.
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
I called you a taxi.
Me too.
Too late.  Just my luck.
I think she liked me.
No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
To the airlift.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
No jokes.  James is in love.
You approve!
The torture of small children--
I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs.  A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was.
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
Oh, yes!  Where's mine?  I want to look like you.
I won't.  Goodnight.
What's their program?
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
Once.
You do it... you first!
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
They took a left at the next light!
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Catch of the day.
What?
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
Who's our back-up on this?
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
Why us?
What story did you give to Davis?
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
We're going to need everyone.
What, Sergeant?
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
Twenty-five percent.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
You're making the right decision, sir.
Stolen?
What motel you staying at?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
What's your name, lover.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Always.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
This isn't a date.
The Rex.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Vivian...
What if someone tries to steal it?
What happened to him?
Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
What do you mean?
Right.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Business.
You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
Oh, god, what?
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
You're being ridiculous.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
Have a good day, gentlemen.
All this because of that whore!
Yes.
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
Yeah.
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
Dummy.
Go for the bucks.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
You bullshittin' me?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
Vivian.
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
Of course.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Gently.
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Yes, some of the time. 
If there are, we'll all be dead.
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
Right, right, sorry.
Has it got any sports in it?
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
As you wish...
My spy network has heard no such news.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
Try ruling the world sometime.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
Thank you.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
Begin!
Inconceivable!
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
It would take a miracle. Bye!
A little bit.
Guess what.
What?
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"Keep a shining in...
Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Mr. Bialystock ...
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
Yes, it's quite possible.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!
Who wrote it?
OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
Good.  I will make the preparations.
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
Very nice girl.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Oh, the best one.
Wagner...
The Graf Spee...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
We won.
Groovy!
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
Oh.
What?
Very early. Dawn.
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
What?
And when she left, she never came back.
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Of course not.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Can I trade in my car and take another?
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
Forty thousand dollars.
Is Mary here?
What do you know about it?
Yes.
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
You're not.
Neither will I.
She was willing to lick the stamps.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
Why not?
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
Can you?
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
I'll lick the stamps.
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Only my share.
Phoenix?
Good night.
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
Is there?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Haven't any.
Do what?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
Indeed, he has often told me.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
What do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
Who are you? What is your name?
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
You found Buckley?
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
He isn't here.
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
What did it say?
But ... the dogs...
No?
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
I'd love to.
And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Here's a wow.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
You weren't going with her?
Who'd steal her body?
You go in for dangerous things.
Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
That is unfortunate.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
But I have some friends waiting.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
Yes.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
You did.
A place you've never been.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
They were just bad men, that's all.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
But I'm curious, Rose.
Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
Don't mention it.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
I said I wouldn't.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
I do, too!
Well, yeah.
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
What are they doing, Doll?
Buddy, that was my place.
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
Of course.
Yes, we know her.
What?
I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Quarter of twelve.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
No, sir.
Well, good night.
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Well, it's Billy.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Oh, yeah?
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Well, no, I didn't actually.
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
More history, Rose.
I had better call Daddy.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Yes, ma'am.
... okay... you made your point.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
Save it.  Just go.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
No you can't.
Relax.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
What of it?  Haven't we waited forever... ?  Haven't we, honey?  Haven't we waited long enough to get this scumbag?
Stop blaming yourself.
Yeah.
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
What about him?
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
Wha... ?
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
No, we're stealing.
No.
Nope.
Bummer.
You can't be serious.
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Well, sir...
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
Can't be worse than you.
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
How'd we do?
A.D. is a C.P.A.
I'm well aware of that.
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
Do tell.
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
All right. Stand by.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
I can't do it, Ben.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Your eyesight will return in time.
Jabba's palace.
Luke!
Leia!
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Your father?
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
How many languages do you speak?
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
On my mother's grave.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Uh huh.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Weiss.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
You're wet.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Now I
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
And you never got the chance?
By accident?
Morning after?
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
Yes, I do.
Yes.
It's not that --
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
Sharp -- Real nice.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
...I can't beat him.
Apollo?
Don't say that.
Christ.
It's not your house --
Get outta my life both of ya's.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
...It's very American.
...This man.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
Move your shoulders down.
Why?
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
I agree.
Bob.
Ya still light seventy.
...Fine.
Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
Hey --
What?
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
What?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
How old?
Spider Rice.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
Freak luck is a strange thing.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
I never had good footwork.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Yo, Paulie.
Absolutely...
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
Gazzo's a good man.
Sure I like her.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
It's all yours.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
He's right here in the...
That's what you woke me up for?
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
I've already seen your photographs.
Divorce?  Never!
Aah!
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
Yeah, that's better.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
My brother.  Get inside.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
A Toon?  Noooo.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Yeah?
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
From this box here...
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Then I'll leave thee.
A challenge, on my life.
Is the day so young?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Of love?
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
'Tis he.
Romeo, come forth.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
Goodnight.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
I have.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Of course.
Well I don't!
So where do you go from here?
You were a soldier, were you?
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Duty calls?
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
There's a problem...
There's been a slight problem.
In here...
You'll die if you leave here.
But you hate each other!
That's it.
I do, I do...
And you respect him.
Soon.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
I didn't expect that he would.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Coordinate what?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
Know what?
Because that's what I would have done...
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
A lot of people died.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
It's my job.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
Right now?
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Finish it!
You sure?
I can't get enough of it.
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
I hear you.
Never heard of it.
Oh, you would have done great.
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
Torch it?!
I...I can't do that.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
You killed him...
Do you have everything?
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
He killed her...
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
I want my share. All of it.
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
HELLLLLP!!!!
Has he?
Nothing.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
And I'd take it out on him.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Great...
Could it have been this?
What?
Hi.
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Oh.
Yeah I'd say C...C.
No I don't.  You sure you haven’t seen her?
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Yeah whaddya want?.
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
Calm down --
Well you're not getting, either.
Hi.
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
Absolutely positively.
What do you think?  Heart attack?
I'm not getting an answer.
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
No, I just assumed...
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Is this about the funny money?
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
No.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
This is a very dangerous man.
Don't look at my ass!
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
Why LA?
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
It's a long story.
Get it out of here!
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
What's a Chinese heaven?
I think we should stop talking.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Who's Benjamin?
Just GO!
This money is evidence.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
How do I know I can trust you?
The Secret Service?  Why?
I'll take him.
No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
I know, but --
Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
Witnesses.
I know a shortcut.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
No.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.
Come on!
It happens.
Excuse me?
It's him.
Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
Oh, baby, you cruel...
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
It's okay. For restaurants.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
What?!
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Griffin?  Where are you.
I do.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
He is very good.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
"Make the shot."
Where do you think she's going?
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
I don't think that's why she ran.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Yes.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Agreed.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
You know, there's no...
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
You humiliated me!
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
I already explained about that.
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
I kissed him back.
So, we'll...
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
It's probably because you got him fired.
Maggie, it's just a joke...
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
I hate boats.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
Walter, I'd love to --
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
That doesn't make any sense.
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
Actually, he sounded nice.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
He lost all the weight... there.
No.
Definitely.
I love you, too.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
Made for each other.
Okay.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
Yes.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Mom, we already...
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Sure you do --
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
It's not that late in Seattle.
It is not --
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
It's Y. O. H.
Window.
What?!
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
No, I'm not, but --
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Somewhere in the middle.
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
-- a slice of pizza --
What do you think?
Is that what she used to sing?
I don't know.
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
Yes.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Get out.
Well...
What do you mean?
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
Sure.  Sure.
Yeah.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
What?
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Ramón -- listen my kids ...
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
No, Why?
Now that's down-right insulting.
Everything go?
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Go ahead.
You get off on abuse or something?
It's the only way to play.
How much time do you have?
You don't like the tune, find another station.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
You can still work.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Why's that?
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
I think on account of his nose.
He doesn't have one.
You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
Sure, Jimmy.
You aren't coming with me.
You don't trust me?
No, I'm good.
Secret recipe.
Hey, okay.
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
And what does this have to do with me?
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
Again, I thank you.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Don't we always take good care of you?
A private, sir?
Shit, that was no big deal.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
Hell, no!
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
It seemed appropriate.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Those guns are close.
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
I changed my mind.
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
What about the company?
Yep, hell of a mission.
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
I know.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Sure, Reiben.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
You have orders, too.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
Yes, sir.
Yeah?
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Lingerie.
We know.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
No, no he's not.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
For going to school?
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Gee, it's easy.
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
I'll be home soon.
Lloyd, give it up.
C'mon, just do it.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I love you dad.
I just had a phone call.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
You're going.
Bon voyage.
I made their lives better.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
You're right.
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Twisted?
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Okay, bye.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
I don't think I am.
What's wrong?
Well, I need to study, and...
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
No, I don't, I don't.
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
Not right now, thanks.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
Seriously, Lloyd.
So what's up?
Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.
What?
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
I called her up.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
Alright.  Key?
I don't know.
We're full on bonded.
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
He is.
I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
War.
Yeah, what's that?
When?
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
There's nothing in the stores.
Nice things cost money.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
They should be.
Yes.
Ah, yes.
No, no, what, what is it?
There will be generations because of what you did.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
Would it do any good?
They've broken their pattern.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Stop it...
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
No, it's me.
You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Tons and tons.
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
But you’ll never get away with it.
No way.
Yeah.
No, it's not.
No. This is a set up.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
Hope you’re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
We'd break some furniture.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
Whatever.
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
But who would operate your camera?
"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Gale?
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Do I?
Good bye Ben.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
Nope.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Absolutely.
To me Hollywood is about death.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
They've got her!
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
And?
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
Fuck!
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Honestly, my life.
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
None.
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
Just because you knew her?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
It's Sarah.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
How do I know their voices are --
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
No I need to call you. Just you.
Oh yeah.
What are you doing here?
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
I'm so sorry... please understand.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
Stop it!
Who is this?
So why did you dial it again?
You have to have a favorite.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Or else what?
I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
...please...
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Please..stop...
I can't think.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
Hold up a sec...
You're sure it was the Hilton?
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
I don't know. I guess.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
What about the cellular phone bill?
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Yes, that's right.
I'll send you a copy.
I want to talk to you.
Do you still think he's innocent?
And why would she do that?
And why is that?
Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Before she dumped him for Steve.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
You'll never get away with this.
What happened?
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Do they know who did it?
They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Tits -- see.
How's that?
So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Good.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
I'll see you.
I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
David... please...
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
Totally unrelated victims.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
Okay.  But, what?
The fingerprints.
Call an ambulance.
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
I don't.  Neither do you.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
It's not what you think it is.
That is.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
Big surprise.
What did you say?
I'm sorry, I only...
I want to have children.  It's just...
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
You fit a lot of descriptions.
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Yes, sir...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
You got it with you?
Oh...
Forget it...
And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
Look?
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Not no more.
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Comancheros...
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
Don't go blamin' yourself...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
We got two around that age...
You'll never get away from me!
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
What?
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Hi, darling.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
What are you talking about-
I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
What?
Yes, something was...
Very funny.
It's good.
Oh
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
Of course not!
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
How?
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
But nothing is happening.
She is always Aphrodite.
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Fifty pounds? What for?
No, then.
What? Who?
Burbage says you have a play.
I have. And chinks to show for it.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
"Out of her favour where I am in love."
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
I liked the dog, for laughs.
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Stand up straight, girl.
Oh, but they can!
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
"Go ask his name--If he be married, My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
"Madam!"
"Madam!"
I am, Master Shakespeare.
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
Is she obedient?
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Oh. What is your name?
A lowly player.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Oh--I am him too!
There is.
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
I must. I must
Oh, but it will end well for love?
I know how to fight!
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
I am going to church.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
Wait there.
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
A theatre poet?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Serve.
I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
You think so?
Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
You're not eating.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Cameron?
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
-- instead of what he is --
The man we know and love.
You see, they don't really know me.
No. Any idea which channel he's on?
Yes.
All right. No problem.
For ever and ever.
It tastes different.
You know we're right.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
You were going to say something.
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
It's about the burglary.
Downstairs.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
No, three. Who said there were four?
Do you smoke?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
Who have you talked to?
What?
Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
Sorry?
But they sneer, don't they?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Here?.
What's it about?
All right.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
Who?
That kid... the hairdresser.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
What do you expect me to do about it?
That's okay too.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I know.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I don't want to see you anymore.
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't want to place you in any position --
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
That headboard.
Don't make conversation with me.
Yeah...
That you're just like your mother.
Yeah.
Great.
She is.
And you need money?
You promised you'd do the show.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
You are today.
I'd cut it...
And?
And what?
I just have to do one little thing.
I don't want to... I swear...
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
-- this guy with Jill.
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
You were great.
-- sure.
Look who's talking.
-- yes, you --
-- do you want ice?
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
It's too late...
I don't know... Jackie?
She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- you know better...
-- took a bus.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You're great.
You've never even been around one.
Okay...  Night, baby.
Hello.
How did it go at the bank?
Hey, I'm, you know --
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
I'll call you.
Who?
Television or movies?
What is.
Where did this come from?
-- yes.
George, now cut this out.
What did you say?
No.
But Mr. Norman said --
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Oh, hey...
-- yeah?
Isn't that bad for it?
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
I wanna hear about it.
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Lester, it just happened.
Wasn't sure it was you.
All right, who're you with? Jill?
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
Fine.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
-- Yeah, honey...
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
-- Yesss?
You're going?
That's fine --
Jill.
-- just wonderful.
No.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
I'm hungry.
Who's Tony?
Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Try to think what it was.
Is there something bad here?
What about Room 237?
You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Danny, come on over here.
And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
Okay, Mom.
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Yes, I'd like you to.
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
It's okay, really.
Delbert Grady.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
A nigger.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
I did?
What line of work are you in now?
I hope it's nothing serious.
What time is it?
Yeah.  It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.  I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
Fine.  Now we're going to make a new rule.  Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
Jack...
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Jack...
Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Wendy...
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Well, it's very... homely.
You're a real booger, you know it?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
Yeah! What is it?
Well... was it a prescription?
When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
There! You see!
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
Yes, Mary?
What you do?
With love.
What?
You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
What is it, Betty?
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Oh my! 
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
What a shame!
Tell me about it.
Again!
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows?
What?
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
Give me a C.  A C!
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
Your cigarette -- out.
What's a concubine?
Would you like that?
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
My what?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
What's wrong with my life?
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
The majority has spoken.
I'm a Christian.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
Then-you run.
I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
But -- wait.
Where is she?
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
She's praying.
That should have tipped us.
It's better than springtime.
She wasn't a nun?
I lied.
What are you spying on?
Bring him.
The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
They need guidance.
May we look at them now?
There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
Have they nothing to fear presently?
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Chosen me?
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Not for lack of trying.
Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
I'm sure I don't know.
Up.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Father said witches live there.
I hear nothing.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Why this tree?
All I saw was their lantern.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
I know.  Hold on.
You are funny.
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
To avenge his father, and the others.
What troubles you?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
I have not been able to face him yet.
Let her go!
Yes... yes.  I think I will...
No.
Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
I can't remember.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
French-fried potaters.
Give me the big'uns.
What you got in there, warshing?
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.
Leave.
Don't tell me what to do.
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Would y'all like that?
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
Why? Hi, Karl.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
They let you out?
They still around, your folks?
How did your mama die?
Well, I hate him.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
What do you mean?
I don't reckon I know.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
It was alive?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Is that right?
Can we play ever' Saturday?
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
I know he does.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
You better go get your things.
Naw.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
No ma'am.
Yes ma'am.
Yeah.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
Can I help you, sir?
I know.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
An invitation?
It's my birthday.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
Fuck you, kid.
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
You usually get two.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
For keeps?
I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
What is this, some kind of joke?
No, it's five thousand dollars.
So I can get my job back.
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
And his parents?
I shouldn't have let him go.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
No thank you.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
Well, if you put it that way...
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
You can't be more specific than that?
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Is your father an artist?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
Appreciation for what?
I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
Why don't you go to the police?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
Thanks. 
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
That's it. In a nutshell.
That money is my whole future.
No wonder he was angry.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
I said.  No further questions.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
I have told the truth.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
Won't take two.
I'll take two.  One for later.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
I think you like learning.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
No spare.
And her farmhouse...?
The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
Obviously.
Is it possible?
Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Okay, doll.
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
It's private.  Go away.
The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
Of course I am.
No we're not.
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
Shave our legs, stupid.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
And I'm Daphne.
Good night, Josephine.
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Security.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Like when?
What?
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
If there's anything I can do for you -
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
No.  It's nice and cozy.
Interesting.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
I may spill something.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
Thirty-four.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road-house, down the coast -
About that roadhouse -
We'll adopt some.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
You're making it up pretty good so far.
Yes, Joe.
I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
Have you ever been with a male band?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Yeah.
You are?
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Not at all.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
My fault.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Now, really -
You have a yacht?
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
No, my flag steward.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
You're flattering me.
You mean - like frigid?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
What else is there for me? 
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Me?
I didn't do anything.  It just happened.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
Goodbye, my darling.
How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
Coffee?
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
You shave with your spats on?
Bacardi 151.
Pub Golf?
But I do. I will. You’re my sister.
Hey.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Mom, please.
There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
Other than, he’s shagging your exgirlfriend?
Oh, hello.
What?
Maybe not her least... There’s always--
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
Both.
He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
I don’t know.
This happened to you?
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn’t be violated.
Okay.
Show me.
What?
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
But nothing did.
You knew?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You want me to let him in?
Hi, kiddo.
I haven’t thought about that in years.
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Can you swim?
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
He'll show up one day.
Where was you, Daddy?
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Come here, son...
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
When's that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
My father taught me...
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
I don't look like no possum!
Thank you, Josie Mae.
When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon' have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.
Good night...
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
Did you tell 'im I was too busy for that kinda stuff?
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Okay.
Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Mph rm rmph!!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
Guess.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Yeah...
She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
I sure did, Phillip!!
Cheers, Terrance!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
Don't believe the hype!!
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
I know.
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Wendy?
You didn't?
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Magnificent, magnificent.
Well I appreciate that.
It certainly is.
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
Well it's a good thing that I did.
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
It's steady, good benefits.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
10-4 good buddy.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Over and out!
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
I understand.
Ready as I'll ever be.
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
No...
Taylor!  Where are you?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
No kiddin'.
Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Thanks.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
I didn't think so.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
He says that to all his wives.
You're a scumbag.
Cool!
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Now swing it out a little to the right...
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Where can I find him?
I'm not here to - I can't...
It's a vicious cycle.
I'd rather you didn't.
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
Plan B is your dad.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Can I come with you?
Fuck plan C!
Breeze, give him his ball back!
Your time is up, busyboy.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
I said back away.
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Nobody move!
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Do you see it?
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
Storm?  What storm?
They didn't tell me anything.
What?
It's impossible.
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
Just worry about yourself.
He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
When was this?
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
They've left, keep watching!
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Internal power.
In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Beth --
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
What are they?
You did, didn't you?
In case you die, too?
I fixed your suit.
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
The refridgerator.
Wait a second --
You don't believe me.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
What?
Squids?
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
Are you?
You tell me.
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
You manifested that, Beth.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
How's that?
By the bunks.
For who?  The fish?
It's an American spacecraft.
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
What?
Our present.
You didn't say that about the food?
Hold on.
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Think about it.
Meaning?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
"We are friends".
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
Does this mean what I think it means?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Know what?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Squint harder.
They never used to send a Navy car.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
Could I learn to feel it?
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
I'm not going alone!
I'll make a report later.
It could be worse...
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
Don't you believe it.
Why didn't you say so before.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
He'll be well cared for.
I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
I read you sir.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
See Threepio!  Do you copy?
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
I didn't see him !
We're the old men, Ace.
Sir, no, sir.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
It looks like an... asteroid.
Funny...
Excuse me...!
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
Who ?
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Good luck at the academy.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
No way, ma'am !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
No thanks, Diz.
You got it.
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Sir, yes, sir !
Courage, I guess.
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Good for you. Go find out.
Yes, sir !
To join with him.
You may proceede.
The information will not be disclosed.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
You saved the ship.
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
I want him here.  Sit down!
And whatever you sensed out here....
Precisely.
The point... 
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
To you, sir?
That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
I quit the movie.
It's in your play.
Why?
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
But why the dalmation?
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
Yes.
Yes...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
I understand...
As the Old Mill goes around...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
And likewise.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
Uh huh.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
You going to ask me in?
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
I can't get it to come out right.
What've you got?
...yes.
...what...?
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
...you think that's right...
...I'm sure that people are upset...
That's so beautiful...
I beg your pardon?
I've been thinking.
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
I'm sorry.
Well, then, what's he doing here?
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
She wasn't in the...
What'll I do for fun?
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
You got to get out of here...
What I...
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
Just him and me.
Mr. Bailey.
Nobody.
I, actually yes.
But we...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
...yes...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Did she throw up?
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
Sure.
It burnt down.
I...
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
Grace...
Um, no.
Why?
I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
How do you know you saw it?
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
How are you getting on with these fine people?
I don't got the money.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..."  Hold on, Bobby...  You've got nothing, and you know it.  By God, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
Sherry, Sherry...
...the city council...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Bet you did.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Givvem a cigarette...
Excellent point.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
That will never happen.
I live.  In the same country.
Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
I'm not.
Let me be the judge of that.
Yes.
Good.  That's very good.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
Honey, she won't d...
You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
But Rache...
No.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
Dad!  You can talk him into anything!
I knew where I was all the time.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Where are you, anyway?
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Thursday's fine...
Ben where do you have to get to?
How do you know?
So where are you?
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!
Something's up wi...
Rachel's not half my age.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
I'm worried.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Don't do this.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
We're going to win this.
A lot smaller.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
I was in there in him.
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
I need practice.
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Yes?
But I came here to...
You're not dying.
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
How's she doing with Brad?
No.
Feeling the pressure?
And her...?
Aw.
Worked.  Like a charm.
What do I have that you don't?
You ride with Annabelle...
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
You heard me: leave the table!
Like what?
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Nice to have you here.
No.
I'm still poor.
You have a bay?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Poison gas.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
No, you don't.
What's an audience going to tell you?
550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
Oh. What happens now?
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
OK!
Gee, you're home early!
What are you doing here?
Can I join you?
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
No.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger.
Again!!
No.
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Hello, is this Pam?
Oh, that's too bad.
Anything I might know about?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
Maybe she has caller ID.
Is it loaded?
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
Whoopee.
Thanks man.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Why? Are we going dancing?
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
What happened?
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
Because I'll be firing at them.
Are the labs in operation?
She's still alive.
Good.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
Richter-we got a problem!
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
Dissent?
There's enough in one vial...
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Possibly some coffee?
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
That's government property, Major.
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
That's right, sir.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Thank you, sir.
That is correct, Major.
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
I'm trying to, sir.
That's close enough, Major.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where, sir?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
What's the target.
Lothar, take your checks now.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
War?
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
Look, can't someone help me?
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
First safety.
Hell, he looks dead.
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Why should they call us back?
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Forget it.  Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.
Have you tried the emergency system?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
I don't anymore.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Was it okay?
Hey, you said you did a video?
Sounds like a bummer.
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
So you can do an album cover?
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, no.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
Sure.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
What, they're looking for her?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Buff is funny. God.
Alright, Pony!
No, no, whoa!
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
You rich?
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
That chick, Erica?
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Yes.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
I don't know.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
Will you just put the gun down?
Is that Bee-Bee?
Come on!
Look, look, just get off my property.
You could've come over.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
Your completely missing the point.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
How?
New ground?
My goal is to make art.
I don't know.
Jeff!
I, yeah.
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
'Bye, Jeff.
No, it's not...
Yeah.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
I don't know.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
What are you saying?
Like?
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Yeah?
I'm moving.
I don't know. I say what I mean.
That's because I am.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
Whatever.
I'm here.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."
Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
"Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm...
... I don't know.  Probably not.
I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Uh...maybe?
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
Your help.
My best friend got pregnant.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Come on.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Why, you sweet kid.
Thank you.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
You'll be waiting for me?
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
You sure have.
Why should you do that?
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
Second generation, huh?
Nice job.
If you please.
Twenty-two.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
No.
What assistant?
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
It is not.  Get out.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
Yes, Norma.
Good.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I went for a walk.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
The doctor suggested it.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Paramount is calling.
But where?
How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
Whatever you say.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
Western Europe.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
No.
You're not afraid are you?
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
I'm not mad at you.
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
What?
Hmmm?
Well, there's several ways to go .
What an adorable hat.
They think I have a concussion.
Why should I believe you?
Oh, sure.
I can't help it if men notice me.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
But what for?
It was just a trim.
No, MR. Danvers.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
A cheap trick.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
Are you happy, Zaltar?
No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
There's no vodka in it.
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
Call me.
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
Uh-huh.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Oh?
I know, I'm the fault.
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
I'm tryin' to.
Columbia.
Columbia.
That what they call you?
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
God, that's what I keep you for.
KRYPTONITE!
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
What will it get me?
We gonna crash?
We back in Metropolis?
That's his sister. Vera Webster.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
Thank ...you.
Anytime.
Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
Whoopee.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Where's the light switch?
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Actually, yes.
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
I'm listening.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
You do?
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
I'll be alright.
Why didn't you go before we left?
That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
I asked the right question.
Shhhhhhh!
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
He has powers as we do . . .
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
North. Keep going North!
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Superman gets mail here?
An angle?
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
Our other dinner guest.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
It always is with Clark.
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
One of them should've been you.
Actually, she's silver-haired.
Big night coming up?
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
No thanks.
Oh.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Even that would be an improvement.
I didn't say a word.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
There was a recipe on the back  --
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
What are you going to do to him?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
What other one?
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
Two.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
Folks'll ask question.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Enjoyed it?
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
It must feel great.
Pink.
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Of time, Luthor.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
She's in trouble?
I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you telling me this?
It does concern me.
C'mon, you know that won't...
Can't you make it later?
A while.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
And they loved Bear.
From what?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
I'll...take it straight.
No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
No.  What's this lawyer business?
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I don't want you to lie.
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
Here we go.
Thanks.
Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
Daddy?
I need money.
I'm a lawyer.
You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
What time in the morning was this?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Yes.
Yes.
Before the actual accident?
Why were you scared?
Yes, I understand.
Yes.
Very slick.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
You don't know that.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
I only had a few hours.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
Give me a chance --
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
J.J., Steve isn't...
No.  I'm going home.
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
What does that mean - integrity?
You're incapable of the truth...
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
This sort of thing!
- that's what I mean!
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
It is a favor, isn't it?
We stick in each others craw.
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Why did you call me?
I can't
What chip?
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
Can I stop by my house?
Anything it samples by physical contact.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
No problemo.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
No problemo.
Trust me.
I have to go away, John.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
So do you.
No.
And Skynet fights back.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Can you get us in there, past security?
No.  There is another chip.
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
Some.
Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
I guess it's possible.
So what is it?
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
You bet.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
I have a duty.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
Sure.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Tough, tough!
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
No!
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
And what did he say?
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Who's conducting?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
One of your people told me.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Yes.
Nope.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
All.
You're a big help.
You must have a girlfriend.
I don't understand...
About where you're from.
That's the way it was told to me.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
Not possible.
Someone?
Kyle...
The year 2027?
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Surrounded by living tissue.
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
I hate the weird ones.
Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
What?
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
We met, this morning.  I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right.  I'm going sailing.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Then, you kiss his ass.
I said I was sorry...
Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note...
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, about this...
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
No.
Please...
Oh.  FIne.
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
Keep it.
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
Nicholas...
Get us out!
... what... ?
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Stop it!
I didn't know what else to call you.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Really?
It's a profound life experience.
Call them.  Trust me.
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Yeah.
Yes.
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
It's different every time.
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
Guess!
Like, this way... sort of...
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
Follow me.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
You warm my heart.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Why?
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
No.
Yes.
No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
No --
Good.
Oh!  You scared me.
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Why'd she kill herself?
She was unhappy.
Fifteen dollars.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
No.  The world has missed you.
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
Then let's go get you one.
Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
I'm not.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
Oh, god.
Sure.
We think?
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
Lookin' good.
Y'what?
Where abouts?
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
Faith.
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Ashamed.
Footloose and fancy free.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
-- Your employer?
I bet.
Have you ever known me not to be.
And how did you get it?
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Overnight.  What about just now?
Only in the movies.
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
It was you.  Downtown.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
No rest for the wicked.
I got half.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Are you finished?
Tell me.
Tell you ...
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Boy.
Just see him, as a favor to me.
He didn't say that.
...Uh-huh.
Ah yes, a music lover.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Cash?!
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
No, Dave, I wasn't.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Uh-huh.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Come on in.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
I knew we'd pay for it.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
It was Big Dave's.
So... who... who actually--
...who among us is in a position to say...
Sure you don't need one?
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
Yeah.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
You don't got a headache?
Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
Ah.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
It better be good.
I'm in.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
What's the combination?
Like hell!
Where the hell are you?
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
You're kidding.
I think I should come with you.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Got my hands full here.
I know.
Not so loud.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Get back!  Now!
Quiet.
Keep the animal quiet.
What's that?
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
How about lunch?
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
I don't understand.
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
Where did you see it?
Gone.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
What are you going to do?
Then it won't go after the others?
For what?
Today.
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
What music?
Do it!
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
It has to be the reality.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.  Hollywood, California, you're on "Tru Talk."
I'm the creator.
Shhh!
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
How about them?
I've got to show you something.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
You hate gambling.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
Well, I made it through another night.
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
When you get to Fiji?
Fine.  I'll tell her.
The whole area's being evacuated.
Well, thank you for your help.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
I'd ask for identification.
You can count on it.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
There are complications.
You got some kind of business with him?
Have you examined them?
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
How?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
-- You saw this experiment?
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
Why not? It's three AM.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
What did you find?
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
I have no idea.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I have. I did. It's done.
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I don't have his number.
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
About what?
Where's Scully?!
I don't know.
I have answers for you.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
He needs to be turned over.
What's wrong?
I know.
What then?
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
What did you see?
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Evil.
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
Oh no... No you don't.
You're kidding me.
Initiating connection.
It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
Sometime yesterday morning.
It's his dog.
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
Sit down.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Whiskey.
Need we go through it all again?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Tell you what?
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
I wish I knew.
Why?
He told you, didn't he?
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
Oh, well.
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Yes.
I have never seen him.
No.
It wasn't important.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Good-bye.
How will I know you?
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
No, not yet.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Pin it on a...
It wasn't petrol.
This is where he vanished.
I suppose you don't believe me.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
All right, Calloway. You win.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Two thirty.
Goodness, that's awkward.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
You wouldn't do anything.
Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
A Roumanian.
What's the name of this girl?
Yes. The man who helped carry him.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Hear the details.
You saw it?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Yes.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
A bit fucking late.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
No.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
Why won't you talk to me?
You can't.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
The sex is better.
No difference.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Who's Eichmann?!!?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
How would you kill him?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
Danny, what about the Jews?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Why?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
I don't think you know what you are.
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
But I wasn't.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
So what Jew would you kill first?
What is happening?
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
You can heat them up and eat with him.
Why? Why would she?
It's not going to be fine. It's --
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
JTS...?
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
What's that?
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
They're not that Jewish.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
He seems to have won it.
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
Congratulations.
What was he like, when he was little?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
What else is there?
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
Don't.
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
He's training.
... What's your name again?
And where did you say you were from?
You're the best, Enzo!
It's okay.
Your mother?
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
I don't know, I just feel it.
Uh... Yes, of course!
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Then, tell me a story.
Absolutely positive.
I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
Why?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
I saw how it has to be.
No.
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
No.  I'm just depressed.
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Yes... It's magic.
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
I know sir. I won't let you down.
Please, call me Mordechai.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Oh!
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
We go to the same temple.
Do what you must.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
You get your money from your husband.
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
I want him to lock me up.
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Tomorrow -—
I want to ask you something.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
I don't know.
You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage -— eh?
Some other time.
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Go on foot.
No. He was kidding Charlie.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Get it out of here!
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Yeah.
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
That doesn't make sense.
I got into a little crap game.
What! You can't be --
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
When will they be back?
That depends what you’re looking at.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Can it be that easy?
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
Have you got a pen?
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
You’re mad...
Leon hung himself...
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
You bastard...
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
The dead can wait.
I don’t smoke. If you could get to the point...
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
Italian? The Mafia...?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?
So, what are you looking for?
I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
... Fine. I’ll go for the safe place.
You... Fuck you!
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
Where?
What kids?
I don’t know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don’t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that’s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Okay. Recommended...
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Any friends?
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
We conclude our transaction.
Anything at all. I presume you won’t want to take the boy with you when you’re finished?  There’s a £500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
An Austrian.
You-you’re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I’m in London. That’s all.
Shut up!
I’m afraid I don’t understand.
Do you know Leon’s parents names?
Oh, I... She just moved. I’ve got her new... It’s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
I’d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don’t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
Cinq cents.
Viens.
Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.
I don’t have your credentials, Nathalie.
You’re sure he said his caller was a man?
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
Now?
Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
They've started the battle without me!
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Well...
It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
It would not be the same without you.
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Why?
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
We want her burned as a witch!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Guess.
In a village called Domremy.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Many things...
Yes...
... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
The wind will be against us...
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
Yes.  We can pray.
No good?  This is a disaster!
Perfectly.
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
I... submit to Our Lord.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
No...
No...!
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Here -- take this instead.
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Not for long...
If you kill him, you kill me!
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
Who?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Yes... lots of things!
Really?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
Whose were they?
Is that bad?
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Who is this "he"?
I want to be at one with Him now.
Yes.
It's nothing.
Really?
No one plays Chopin like you.
Don't worry, it won't last long.
Just over a year.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
It certainly was.
They were taking you away.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Bitch!
Where do you live?
In the attic.
It will be very dramatic.
Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives.
Yes, I thought that.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
No, not words.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
It must come.
You've missed this bit.
She never gives him a turn.
What will I play?
Play a song then
Naw, it's okay.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
What?
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
I'm out, Johnny.
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Shove off, Duff.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Mottola.
Hackers.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
You never do, kid.
I wanna play for Lonnegan.
Yeh, it was easy.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
Five and call.
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
No.
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Okay, Tootsie.
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
So could Shaw.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
I'm in.
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
Just as long as I get to finish the play.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
I'm sorry.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
That is, if it's all right with you.
Don't cry.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Then what are you hiding?
You hand that over to the police.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Yes.
What would your mother say to that?
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Ask him.  I don't know.
I'm asking you.
So you say -  Go on, Bob.
No.
--was Wynant's.
Well....
I see.
Why yes.
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
I'll get some.
Chris -- Chris -- !
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
You're going to return every cent of it!
Good.
Well, let me do that for you.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
S'long.
Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
They'll want more than your word for that.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
Rye.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Maybe a drink would help you.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Well, didn't you?
No.  It's a Christmas present.
You did.
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Did I give it to you?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
I don't know.
Looks like a hold-up!
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Well, don't they?
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
I hope you're well.
No, Mr. Charles.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I just wanted to tell you...
I'm fired.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
Wha...
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
What do you figure it to be?
All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
Maybe we should split it up now.
What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
You said he was a deserter.
You don't know that.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
I out rank you, that's why.
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
I have to answer him.
There might be something in there.
There might be.
I did it!  I got the box open.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
A car?  You're going to buy a car?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
They're not going to--
...I know.
Just relax.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
Where the hell is it!?
So where do we start?
He's not going to leave us.
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
We'll find our way!  We'll...
We'll lie.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Yeah.
Makes two of us.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
Is that good, or bad?
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
What?
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
That's in two days.
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
At-at-at-at-at.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
Oh, no.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Violation?
4732...?
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
Now.
Now?
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
Look,dirt!
Looks like food.
You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
Not very encouraging.
I want you for my roommate.
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
No, I...
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
What kind of answer is that?
All the insides are gone!
Shut up.
They're not here.
And you are...?
-Where?
Damn.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Just do it.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
Now wait just a fucking-
Then let's go see what they missed.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Which one's which?
Where you guys at?
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
Which one's which?
I know. I warned them.
Stay in the truck.
Maybe she knows your old man.
Look, it's important.
What kind of bomb was it?
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
Quiet!
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
I thought I told you--
I know.
Yes.
And diamonds in the front.
Diamonds all over.
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
No!
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
Like it?
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
I want to see-- 
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
Um-hum ...
I hope so, too.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
Thank you!
Gaston Monescu.
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Darling!
But it's not enough!
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
Now, Lily--
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
No. What is it? Tell me.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Right!
This used to be my secretary's room.
Beautiful.
Lipstick?
Correct!  Good night.
Like that!
Any minute I want!
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
Mariette!
Lovely.
Goodbye ... 
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Yes, my bag!
But you saw it here.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
Don't you mean work me?
Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
So do I.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
Good. Settled then.
Can I bum a cigarette?
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
I know what ice fishing is!
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
If only it were that simple.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
You had it the entire time?!
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances.  What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Get moving--
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Very much--
Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
I'll be there--Good-by.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Sally--!
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
What?--
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
Lose?--I won a little--
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Shortie, look!
--there's thousands of 'em!
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Why?
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
O.K. Heads you win.
In New York.
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
That's fine.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
I'll never love anybody else.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
What's the matter, Mary?
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
What's he got that I haven't got?
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Thirty one's and two ten's?
It all depends on what you're used to.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Then why did you run away?
Beauty, ain't he?
I asked where you got him.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Well now that's a little more Like it.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Well... 'bye.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Here it come: one-two-
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
I'll remember you said that.
Sorry, sorry...
A which?
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
I laugh sometimes
You're a little touchy about it.
Room service.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
I know, me too.  What should we do About it?
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
Wyatt...
You did.  Well... thank you.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Really?  You sure?
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
What're you talkin' about?
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
That a fact?
Jack...
Sure...
You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Yeah, and dangerous.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Sir Elliot.
Sightseeing.
...Words to live by?
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
- We all want what we can't have?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Does it work on cash machines?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
They point, I shoot.
Depends what number you write.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
Have we met?
Sidney Winch.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
He was my father's best friend!
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
My father left me the business.
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
Of course.
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
No -
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
It's Bond!
Abort the cruise.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
I told her I would if she would give me time.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
Like muddy waters?
It was nip and tuck.
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
I'm going back home with Harry.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
You know the man next door is near death.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
You can't!
Go away.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Shield your eyes!
Yeah, right.
What?!
It's ok.  Everything's under control.
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Oh no, Hannah!
Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
You murdering dog!
Toss 'im overboard!
He got it, Woody!
Last present!
It's busted.
Got it.
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Speed up!
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
I carried you up to your bed.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
She'll have to learn.
Get away from me...
What did I do wrong?
Do what?  Oh, I see.
Living with him put years on me.
I've got a present for you...
Everything is gone, now.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
It's all right, Finn.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I can't do that.
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
So my wife is lying?
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
At least she's alive.
Caroline --
He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do.  It wasn't my pot.
Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
Oh, yes I can.
Yes.
You do?  What else you do?
Not like.  It is.
We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
We keep our mouths shut.
No.
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
Right.  But, that's not the biggest problem.  One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else.  It doesn't smell like coke.  It doesn't look like coke.  And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test.  It could be anything.  Maybe it's already happening.  I mean, how would we know?
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
Oh, man --
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
What do you mean?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Well, why didn't you bring them?
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
Christ.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
You were in my way.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Ninteen.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Right. You can't sleep here.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Can I see you again?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.
No.
Have you got any gear on you?
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
Who wrote it?
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
Say something, Mark, say something --
Fuck you.
It was my fucking television.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
But where?
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Join my quest.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
I don't understand.
Jim.
Goodnight, Bones.
Captain, what have I done -
If you think it would help.
I have a half brother.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
The emergency channel, open.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
I'm afraid of nothing.
No conditions.
I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Oh. Anything else?
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
Meanwhile, he might find it.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Well, isn't it -- ?
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Stranger and stranger...
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
Jump.
Probably.
We have to talk.
You're getting out of the business?
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
We have to.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
I had to...in the games...
It's something Users do.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Where are you going?
Out.
Where are you off to young lady?
Yes.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Son of a bitch!
It can't be.
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Uh, yes, it is important.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
Why?
Do you still love your husband?
It makes you tell the truth?
No.  But I wanted to.
What?
No.  Much more.
And you've got one.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
What is it you need me to do?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
He wants to speak with you.
The oriental.
Want some Goobers?
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
Is that your real name? Really?
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
What time is it?
How 'bout me what?
What do you do?
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
You mean she got a bad batch?
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
That dazzling imagination.
My pimp.
A real live pimp?
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
Thank you.
Write down Drexl's address.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Is this a joke?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
Cancoon.
That rhymes.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
Every word of it.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
The zoo.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
He trusts you?
No.
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
That good, huh?
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Who is he?
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
McTeague.
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Or a supporting actor -
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Do you live here?
You're right. It is.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
No.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Uh, what?
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
I need to go.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
It's so clean.  No germs.
I have to go.
No, 1995 is the past.
What?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
Clues?  What kind of clues?
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
Who's keeping an eye on you?
The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
I've got one now.
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
Shot!  Who shot you?
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
I...I...We need cash, James.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
What's that mean?
What are you talking about???
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
How did you find me?
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
I said I was sorry.
That's 'cause he's dead.
What do you want for free?
We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
More or less.
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
Out of here.
Yeah.  Just a little short. Figures.  I just wanted to get out, that's all.
How much time?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
No charge.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
We ain't got no Beck's.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Genuine Draft?
It'd serve you right.  Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
You didn't hear something?
When did you buy a gun?
You sure you can manage?
You're not from around here, are you?
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
What happens if you lose?
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
I didn't say it bothered me.
Those are white words, not ours.
What?
Beautiful?
I'm guessing no.
You could just leave him.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I wanted to talk.
There is no us, remember?
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
I don't know.
Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
No.
Wait.  What about . . . him?
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
You killed a man for no reason!
Now what?
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
It's . . . it's locked.
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
How do you know if you've never tried?
No.
Talk?  About what?
About what you said this morning.
What makes you say that?
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
I came to kill her.
You're not talking sense.
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I've had time to get over it.
You're too quick for me.
For what?
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
They're not very imaginative?
Not before I settle with you.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
The old lady?
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
I didn't do anything.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
More or less.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
Oh, shit!
Give it to me!
Yeah...
That's a solid name.
Talk?  About what?
I'm not rambling.
You meant it.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
Two-hundred dollars?
Oz.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
So?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Great!
Nothing.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
What?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Do you have to call me that?
Maybe I don't want you to.
What happened to your hand?
Accident.
That's all right.  I got it.
What happens when you lose?
I guess it must.
What do you do anyway?
The same thing you do.
I have an idea.
You know what I want.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Nothing.
Don't feel like nothing.
Yeah.
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I'm not coming back.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
Get in.
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
Which you don't have.
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
Wrong number.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
You haven't even looked at them once.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
Wow.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Yes.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
Rust?
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
Was it serious?
You assumed wrong.
Telling when people have done something wrong?
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
There's no more left?
That's great.
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
Did you get up from your seat?
No.
And what was that explanation?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
He give 'em names?
You ain't dead.
Three days? I must be.
That big guy lookin' for me?
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
They really got all that money, them whores?
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Been gone near three years now.
Huh?
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
You better get on back, Miss.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
Yeah.
Huh?
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
She gave me the evil eye.
Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
Yeah... you said that last night.
Two.
Tom?
Fuck you.
Yeah.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Bear with me here...
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
A glass of water would be nice.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
I don't want to know.
You are a criminal.
Dig.
County. I was in for fraud.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
Not if we do it my way.
We'll make it.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
This is totally irrelevant.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
I said I never heard of him.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
As far as we know, nothing.
... tell me about this case.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
You thought it was just.
What is the truth?
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
We went to Code Blue...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
Yes.
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Yes!
No.
Through, through his book.
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
Nothing further, your Honor.
You may step down.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I thought I would need it.
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
'Code Blue'...
That's what I'd planned to...
...What difference would...
Thank you.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
Yes.
You're going to settle out of court?
) I'm sorry ...?
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
I was held up.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
Ready, your Honor.
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Are you done?
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
Pardon?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Is this a bad time.
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Is there going to be a later...?
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Yes.   We've all got to let go.
Call the A.M.A.  to Laura) ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse...
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
...he's a good man...
...I have to stand up for her...
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
Oh shit, what's today?
I can't talk now.
Read me what she said.
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
... fifty thousand dollars?
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
She did?
Hi.  How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
Yes.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Yes.
What happened in those three...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
How'm I doing so far?
He won't talk.
No.
How often does this happen?
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Yes.
Nothing.
Let me come in.
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
Who you are --
About three years.
Why?
Okay.
Tomorrow morning.
Yes.
No.
That's not very complimentary, either.
Yes --
But Scottie, you don't have to!
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
Too late. I've got my face on.
All in good time.
Can't you see?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
I need you.
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Yes!
I don't know... Switzerland?
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
At...
Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
You like it, too.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
Wander about.
No... it's wrong.
What?
No... this is the first time for me, too.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Knowing I have to die...
Home?
How do you know?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
It's all there. It's no dream.
I won't lose you.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Please answer my question.
What's tomorrow?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Johnny, the doctors explained --
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
It's where you belong.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
That!?!
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Okay.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Who?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Just wander.
Oh?
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child.
How?
Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted. 
How soon can it be altered?
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
What's that?
You're an asshole.
I don't have to...
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
Don't point at me.
You want to hear me out?
What do you think you are doing?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
I can't do this.
No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
They're singing.
Are you solid with that?
What does that mean?
Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
The groom?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
Give me two more.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
What kind of words?
I'm talking about prayer.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
I don't know! I just want to get married.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Now?
Isn't it a little late?
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
You're sick.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
What?
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
Sent it.
I think so.
I wouldn't know.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
Charles Moore for instants.
He's quiet.
Why? What's his problem?
Kiss me...?
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Nesting?
What!
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
No way.
I won't even discuss it.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Yeah. You.
Okay. Okay.
No.
Don't even.
Call the police.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
What does that mean?
So what do we do?
About what?
Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
He's your brother.
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
I think so.
What?
I have no idea.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
My God...
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
No, the children sleep with me.
Was that difficult to get?
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
Evil.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Yes.
Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
That's it.
And in the vegetable plot?
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
He was asking for it.
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
What are you going to do?
You're happy, aren't you!
You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
Why did he kill himself?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
How much do you want for him?
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Mother.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
I have a headache.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
He was a computer program for crissake.
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
Then I guess we're even.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
Got it.
I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
I'm still making adjustments...
You're...such a wimp.
It feels so.. .real.
How do you kill it?
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
What's wrong with Parker?
Help me get out of here.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Stop me.
Enjoying yourself?
You like baseball?
If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
You're not capable of it.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
That, or living through him...
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Where did you plant the C-4?!
Where did you plant the C-4?!

50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
What if they call him?
You sure?
What was that?
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?

There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.

Nope.
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Yes, but...
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Um...yes.

I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...

We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.

I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Please.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
Like what?
Don't.
Three o'clock.
I am, really.
To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
I know.
Tomorrow.
Why?
Hurry...
Unless you need me to come home...
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.

Yep.
You know what that does to me.
You're kidding.
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?

And this - if you decide to take the rest.
Better than most, I suppose.

Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
No she didn't...
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...

Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
My room?
Just a formality.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
That's a crappy thing to say.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
In what sense?
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
You never know around here.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
To the best hiding place in the world.
Tell me more.
I see.
That's hard to believe.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
Yellow pages?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
I'll make you very proud.
Like what?
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Of course I like girls.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.
It's about your parents.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
Kelly.
Thanks.
And where might that be?
Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
Then what?
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
What about witnesses?
You didn't cuff her?
Yeah... okay... he did
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
I said he did.
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
Hi, Mon.
You notice my new jumper?
I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
A friend of mine bought a boat.
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Okay.  I love you too.
Say you love me.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
Just like that?
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
Yeah, or get me drowned.
Put Kelly on too.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Jim West.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
I'll work on it.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
All that jumping and kicking.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
And people are actually fooled by that?
What is this?  A whole new train?
I'm sure we will.
Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
I've had some practice.
That'll be all, boys.
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
No, sir... just a businessman.
How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Let's go.
Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
No.  I mean yes.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
Of course!  I promise!
Where the hell did you come from?
You?
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
What do I need for that?
The limitless power of...
She's too powerful, Raziel
Surrender!!
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
Pretty much.
No... I saw the man who killed him.
No pistol. Ever.
Have you got your gun on now?
Maybe.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
You have no right to keep us here.
I can't.
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
No, no doctor...
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Something wrong with buttons?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
That's your way, not mine.
Here. Whenever you want them.
Say again?
You'd lie to protect him.
You're the first one he'll contact.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
I know.
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
I don't think she knows.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
No --
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
To see?
Who are you?
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Oh!  Well....
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Oh --
Oil can....
Oh...
Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Look -- it ticks!
The nerve.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Ohh!
Oh --
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Ohh!
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Where's Kansas?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
To Oz?
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Did you just hear what I just heard?
I -- Oh --
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
We do.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Now, now, don't fret.
Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
Oh, no!
Yeah --
It makes you nervous?
You promised us real things -- a real...
Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
With this?
Alright then, brunch.
Then it’s no longer a bomb?
Makes her look even more innocent.
Made to look just like an accident.
Elektra would control it all.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
Who did you get it from?
Your last chance. Take the money.
Yes.
You knew him well?
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
If you’ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I don’t need a third...
...you should rest.
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
Five more turns and your neck will break.
You turned Renard.
It is my oil!  Mine and my family’s!
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
And the payoff on the tables?
Where?
Your father...
Yes.  Au revoir...
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Because --
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Cured, yes.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
Play one.  Educate yourself.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
Laurie --
They're practically on us . . .
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
Where did he go?
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
I don't think she's coming with us.
With lots of ketchup?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Did you know he was back on the streets?
Then why don't you ask him?!?
Am I free to go?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Maybe I'll do that.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Looks like a diner.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
What do I get out of it?
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
That's exactly why we need them.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
What do you get if you finish?
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
You're joking, right?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
You're serious?
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
Here we go again.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Why you dogging me up?
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
Had to do what I had to do.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
We all do.
It's too far.
If necessary.
Senator?
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
What do you want?
What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
To find Rogue.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
The way what is going to be?
And who might you be?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
No!
What was your grandfather's name?
Victor Frankenstein.
Yes, sir.
MMMmmmm.
Well... yes.
Of course.
Oh, darling -- so will I.
Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Darling, you mustn't worry so.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
It seems fine.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
Good.
Yes?
A piece of what?
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
How do you do?
What are you doing here?
What?
How?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
... I'm glad that's...
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Act casual!
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
That's what we're paid for.
What???
That sound good, boss.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Is everything ready?
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Well...
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Well, this explains the music.
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Are you serious??
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
Food!
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
Which one?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.

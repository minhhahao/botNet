Just read that in Bender's voice
I would hope everyone knew the source of the original quote. Applying it to dispatch is what's be attributed to larry.
I am infuriated that you would imply that just because he ate these few doughnuts that it would somehow influence his appearance... Screw you, I'm Mr. Manager.

If they're for all intents and purposes identical, then what does it matter?
I think he's probably the keymaster, right?
Helvetica?
&gt;go grab one of those holders that you can store like 5 picks on a mic stand on newlinechar  newlinechar Or use a stripe of electrical tape and put as many as you want on.
i tried everything and i can't see past the 2k logo :(
...yet
I'm not disagreeing with that part.  The zero chance of getting a job where you don't meet the requirements part is what I don't agree with.
Indeed it is. It's just $4 shipping.
oh thank you!  Do you have the same username on SG?  I will friend you :)
you and the fucking socks &amp; sandals. 
I am pretty good at warning my SO. I can feel things physically right away. It still doesn't make it easy or non-stressful, though.
Roosevelt, NO! Get out of there!
Why would you need an excuse to play with legos anyways? Everyone should play with legos. Legos are awesome.
I hate the button mash game. I see my BIOS screen for a few seconds, mashing all the way, and it often just decided not to acknowledge it. Most annoying thing ever.
Success!
And fully clothed, or was that changed in Vatican II?
Yes indeed. It's not too difficult to get the parts outof the case, its just a pain because everything is covered in oil.
Every time anyone tests for anything, there will be false positives.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm inclined to believe whiskeytango because protesting innocence here will have no effect. If he manages to 'convince' us...he's still in the same boat.
I love that first one! Well done!
I know what you are getting at but Good Charlotte was never cool.  They were shitty right off the bat and polarizing in the way that Green Day is now.
Analphobic?
[](/megustaperfect 'Sure?')
I like your style
... who really likes salsa?
What's a post sex op dick look like?
I don't think he was. newlinechar Edit - I went back and watch carefully at both his hands and even at 2:20 it still looks legit.  As hard as it seems, having seen what Tommy Emmanual can do, this isn't exactly out of the realms of possibility.
Yeah, but nothing compared to Smash or Nitro. It's good, but its not that good.
why'd the police take them?
I think in Windows 7 all the help suggestions are 'Just google it'.
Red on black, suck my back.
Were you really disappointed when you logged in the next morning looking for a full inventory of Iron?
but it sure as hell will make you forget 
DJ YHWH spins fat beatz, yo.
Late night. Couldn't sleep. Turned to reddit like always.
Looks like we are about to find out.  Obama said he would stop the raids on legit medicinal organizations but either that was political double talk or the DEA is a rabid dog that he cant control because they most certainly have not stopped.
I think the main thing you have to realize is that queue dodging itself lowers your ELO.
Does she discipline her bahhday?
That's what she said
About 100 yards.
This is legit. Upvoted.
Yeah no kidding. I had half my classes in trailers outside the school.
I like how the only thing he saw wrong with passing out checks from tobacco companies to other politicians is that he did it on the house floor.
